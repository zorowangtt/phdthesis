Most of the approaches to stress tensor analysis of molecules in the literature assume that the interatomic forces are pairwise; however commonly used force-field functions contain multi-body interactions. To address this issue, we derived new mathematical formulae for atomic forces based on force-field functions, in which the total force acting on each atom is expressed as a summation of pairwise interatomic forces. Then, a computer program for stress tensor analysis was developed, and it successfully characterized the mechanical features of molecules at the atomic level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The heme-based oxygen sensor protein AfGcHK is a globincoupled histidine kinase in the soil bacterium Anaeromyxobacter sp. Fw109-5. Its C-terminal functional domain exhibits autophosphorylation activity induced by oxygen binding to the heme-Fe(II) complex located in the oxygen-sensing N-terminal globin domain.Adetailed understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms in heme-containing sensor proteins remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of the globin domain's dimerization interface in signal transduction in AfGcHK. We present a crystal structure of a monomeric imidazole-bound AfGcHK globin domain at 1.8 Å resolution, revealing that the helices of theWTglobin dimer are under tension and suggesting that Tyr-15 plays a role in both this tension and the globin domain's dimerization. Biophysical experiments revealed that whereas the isolated WT globin domain is dimeric in solution, the Y15A and Y15G variants in which Tyr-15 is replaced with Ala or Gly, respectively, are monomeric. Additionally, we found that although the dimerization of the full-length protein is preserved via the kinase domain dimerization interface in all variants, full-length AfGcHK variants bearing the Y15A or Y15G substitutions lack enzymatic activity. The combined structural and biophysical results presented here indicate that Tyr-15 plays a key role in the dimerization of the globin domain of AfGcHK and that globin domain dimerization is essential for internal signal transduction and autophosphorylation in this protein. These findings provide critical insights into the signal transduction mechanism of the histidine kinase AfGcHK from Anaeromyxobacter.},

	abstract = {Long-range electron transfer is coupled to proton transfer in a wide range of chemically and biologically important processes. Recently the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) rate constants for a series of biomimetic oligoproline peptides linking Ru(bpy)32+ to tyrosine were shown to exhibit a substantially shallower dependence on the number of proline spacers compared to the analogous electron transfer (ET) systems. The experiments implicated a concerted PCET mechanism involving intramolecular electron transfer from tyrosine to Ru(bpy)33+ and proton transfer from tyrosine to a hydrogen phosphate dianion. Herein these PCET systems, as well as the analogous ET systems, are studied with microsecond molecular dynamics, and the ET and PCET rate constants are calculated with the corresponding nonadiabatic theories. The molecular dynamics simulations illustrate that smaller ET donor-acceptor distances are sampled by the PCET systems than by the analogous ET systems. The shallower dependence of the PCET rate constant on the ET donor-acceptor distance is explained in terms of an additional positive, distance-dependent electrostatic term in the PCET driving force, which attenuates the rate constant at smaller distances. This electrostatic term depends on the change in the electrostatic interaction between the charges on each end of the bridge and can be modified by altering these charges. On the basis of these insights, this theory predicted a less shallow distance dependence of the PCET rate constant when imidazole rather than hydrogen phosphate serves as the proton acceptor, even though their pKa values are similar. This theoretical prediction was subsequently validated experimentally, illustrating that long-range electron transfer processes can be tuned by modifying the nature of the proton acceptor in concerted PCET processes. This level of control has broad implications for the design of more effective charge-transfer systems.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of the cyanide anion bound to sperm-whale myoglobin is investigated using atomistic simulations. With density-functional theory, a 2D potential energy surface for the cyanide-heme complex is calculated. Two deep minima with a stabilization energy of ≈ 50 kcal/mol corresponding to two different binding orientations (Fe-CN and Fe-NC) of the ligand are found. The Fe-CN conformation is favored over Fe-NC by several kcal/mol. Mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations show that the binding orientation affects the bond strength of the ligand, with a significantly different bond length and a 25 cm-1 shift in the fundamental CN-frequency. For the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a 3-center fluctuating charge model for the Fe-CN unit is developed that captures polarization and ligand-metal charge transfer. Stability arguments based on the energetics around the active site and the CN- frequency shifts suggest that the Fe-CN conformation with ε-protonation of Hisε64 are most likely, which is in agreement with experiment. Both equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD simulations are carried out to investigate the relaxation time scale and possible relaxation pathways in bound MbCN. The nonequilibrium MD simulations with a vibrationally excited ligand reveal that vibrational relaxation takes place on a time scale of hundreds of picoseconds within the active site. This finding supports the hypothesis that the experimentally observed relaxation rate (3.6 ps) reflects the repopulation of the electronic ground state. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Elucidating signal transduction between sensor and output domains is highly challenging given the size, flexibility and dynamics of histidine kinases. However, recent structural work has provided snapshots of the catalytic mechanisms of the three enzymatic reactions and described the conformation and dynamics of the enzymatic moiety in the kinase-competent and phosphatase-competent states. Insight into signalling mechanisms across the membrane is also starting to emerge from new crystal structures encompassing both sensor and transducer domains of sensor histidine kinases.

As a result, the difference map of EEN between the deoxy and oxy (deoxy and carbomonooxy) states clearly demonstrated the allosteric transition, although the structural changes by ligand binding are small. It is known that the FixLH forms a homodimer in solution, although neither O 2 nor CO binding exhibits cooperativity. Therefore, we conjectured that the primary event after ligand binding occurs essentially at the monomer level, and it is subsequently followed by quaternary structural changes. The difference EEN maps showed that two regions, (A) the junction between the coiled-coil linker and the sensor domain and (B) the potential dimer interface, experienced considerable change of the energy-transport coefficients, indicating that these two regions play important roles in quaternary structural changes and signal transduction in response to ligand binding.},

	abstract = {Background: The FixL protein is a heme-based sensor. Binding of oxygen to a unique heme domain inhibits a kinase domain of the type found in two- component regulators. Oxygen association is slow, but the dissociation rate is comparable to that of myoglobins. We have probed the size and chemistry of the FixL heme pocket by measuring the affinities, on rates and off rates for a wide variety of ferric heme ligands. Cyanide, but not fluoride, regulates the kinase activity. To examine how the sensory heme domain interacts with the kinase, we asked how the presence of the kinase domain affects ligand binding. Results: The affinities of ferric FixL for heme ligands follow the same trend as their pK(a) values: cyanide ¿ 4-methyl imidazole ¿ imidazole ¿ fluoride ¿ azide ¿¿ thiocyanate. The association rates follow the reverse trend. Striking differences from myoglobin include a 6-fold greater affinity for, and faster binding to, the bulky ligand imidazole, a 14-fold faster on rate for nitric oxide, a 2 800-fold lower affinity for azide, and a complete failure to bind thiocyanate. The presence of the kinase domain does not alter the affinity or binding kinetics of the high-spin ligand fluoride, but affects the off rates of other ligands. The EPR spectrum shows a characteristic pentacoordinate nitrosyl heme, indicating that the Fe-His bond in FixL is strained. Conclusions: The importance of ligand deprotonation to the on rates and the fact that large ligands bind readily indicate that the heme pocket is open and apolar. Ligand basicity strongly influences the strength of binding. The destabilization of inhibitory ligands by the presence of the kinase domain is consistent with a 'load' imposed by coupling to the inactivating mechanism.},

	abstract = {FixL is a heme-based O2 sensor protein, which responds to low O2 concentrations by activating the transcriptional activator FixJ. Signal transduction is initiated by the dissociation of O2 from the sensor domain of FixL, resulting in protein conformational changes that are transmitted to a histidine kinase domain. To gain insight into the FixL sensing mechanism, we monitored changes in the protein s structure in the picosecond to millisecond time frame, following the dissociation of the ligand using time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. This study presents the time-resolved resonance Raman spectra of Sinorhizobium meliloti FixL upon O 2 dissociation, as well as upon CO dissociation. The FixL spectra show that there are three steps in the dynamic structural changes that result from ligand dissociation. Ligand-dependent structural dynamics are observed in the earliest step. On the basis of comparisons of these structural changes, a scheme for the signal transduction of FixL is proposed which supports the FG loop switch mechanism. Similar spectral changes were observed both for the sensor domain and for the full-length protein, although structural changes occurred faster with the former than with the latter. This difference in rate suggests that the structural changes occurring in the heme pocket are coupled to those of the kinase domain.

	abstract = {FixL is a prototype for heme-based sensors, multidomain proteins that typically couple a histidine protein kinase activity to a heme-binding domain for sensing of diatomic gases such as oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide. Despite the relatively well-developed understanding of FixL, the importance of some of its domains has been unclear. To explore the impact of domain-domain interactions on oxygen sensing and signal transduction, we characterized and investigated Rhizobium etli hybrid sensor ReFixL. In ReFixL, the core heme-containing PAS domain and kinase region is preceded by an N-terminal PAS domain of unknown function and followed by a C-terminal receiver domain. The latter resembles a target substrate domain that usually occurs independently of the kinase and contains a phosphorylatable aspartate residue. We isolated the full-length ReFixL as a soluble holoprotein with a single heme b cofactor. Despite a low affinity for oxygen (Kd for O2 of 738 μM), the kinase activity was completely switched off by O2 at concentrations well below the Kd. A deletion of the first PAS domain strongly increased the oxygen affinity but essentially prohibited autophosphorylation, although the truncated protein was competent to accept phosphoryl groups in trans. These studies provide new insights into histidyl-aspartyl phosphoryl transfers in two-component systems and suggest that the control of ligand affinity and signal transduction by PAS domains can be direct or indirect. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {¡p¿The most common physiological strategy for detecting the gases oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide is signal transduction by heme-based sensors, a broad class of modular proteins in which a heme-binding domain governs the activity of a neighboring transmitter domain. Different structures are possible for the heme-binding domains in these sensors, but, so far, the Per-ARNT-Sim motif, or PAS domain, is the one most commonly encountered. Heme-binding PAS (heme-PAS) domains can accomplish ligand-dependent switching of a variety of partner domains, including histidine kinase, phosphodiesterase, and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding modules. Proteins with heme-PAS domains occur in all kingdoms of life and are quite diverse in their physiological roles. Examples include the neuronal bHLH-PAS carbon monoxide sensor NPAS2 that is implicated in the mammalian circadian clock, the acetobacterial oxygen sensor AxPDEA1 that directs cellulose production, and the rhizobial oxygen sensor FixL, which governs nitrogen fixation. What factors determine the range of detection of these sensors? How do they transduce their signal? This review examines the recent advances in answering these questions.¡/p¿},

	abstract = {In the heme-based oxygen sensor protein FixL, conformational changes induced by oxygen binding to the heme sensor domain regulate the activity of a neighboring histidine kinase, eventually restricting expression of specific genes to hypoxic conditions. The conserved arginine 220 residue is suggested to play a key role in the signal transduction mechanism. To obtain detailed insights into the role of this residue, we replaced Arg220 by histidine (R220H), glutamine (R220Q), glutamate (R220E), and isoleucine (R220I) in the heme domain FixLH from Bradyrhizobium japonicum. These mutations resulted in dramatic changes in the O2 affinity with Kd values in the order R220I ¡ R220Q ¡ wild type ¡ R220H. For the R220H and R220Q mutants, residue 220 interacts with the bound O2 or CO ligands, as seen by resonance Raman spectroscopy. For the osy-adducts, this H-bond modifies the π acidity of the O2 ligand, and its strength is correlated with the back-bonding-sensitive ν4 frequency, the koff value for O2 dissociation, and heme core-size conformational changes. This effect is especially strong for the wild-type protein where Arg 220 is, in addition, positively charged. These observations strongly suggest that neither strong ligand fixation nor the displacement of residue 220 into the heme distal pocket are solely responsible for the reported heme conformational changes associated with kinase activity regulation, but that a significant decrease of the heme π* electron density because of strong back-bonding toward the oxygen ligand also plays a key role. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The Fα-helix variants R200A, E, Q, H, Y197A, and D195A were expressed at reasonable levels and purified to homogeneity. The R200I and Y201A variants did not express in observable quantities.

Deoxy-RmFixL is a histidine protein kinase that catalyzes a phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the aspartate 54 residue of RmFixJ; RmFixJ is a response regulator that becomes activated as a transcription factor by phosphorylation. Association of O2 with a heme-binding domain in RmFixL triggers a conformational change that inhibits its kinase activity. Here we consider whether this inhibition is achieved by disrupting binding of either of the substrates, i.e., RmFixJ or ATP, to the RmFixL kinase. The ATP affinities of the oxy and deoxy states were compared via competition of ATP against TNP-nucleotide fluorophores. The influence of O2 on formation of the RmFixL-RmFixJ complex was investigated by fluorescence polarization. Oxygen dramatically inhibited the reaction of the RmFixL-RmFixJ complex with ATP but affected neither ATP binding (Kd ∼ 100 μM) nor RmFixL-RmFixJ complex formation (Kd ∼ 4 μM), indicating that inhibition of the kinase by the oxy-heme in RmFixL is achieved by inactivating the catalytic site, rather than by blocking the association of this enzyme with either of its substrates. An 8-fold enhancement of the rate of reaction of RmFixL with ATP in a deoxy-AmFixL-D54N RmFixJ complex, compared to that in isolated deoxy-RmFixL, exposes the strength of the allosteric effect of RmPixJ on the reaction.

	abstract = {The heme-PAS is a specialized domain with which a broad class of signal-transducing heme proteins detect physiological heme ligands. Such domains exhibit a wide range of ligand binding parameters, yet they are all expected to feature an α-β heme binding fold and a predominantly hydrophobic heme distal pocket without a distal histidine. We have compared, for the first time, the resonance Raman spectra of several heme-PASs: the heme-binding domains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL, Escherichia coli Dos, Acetobacter xylinum PDEA1, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Dos. In all cases, the νFe-CO and νC-O values of the carbonmonoxy forms were consistent with coordination of the heme iron to histidine on the proximal side and binding of the CO without electrostatic interaction with the heme distal pocket. EcDos was unusual in having predominantly hexacoordinate heme iron in the deoxy and met forms. Despite an evident lack of CO interaction with the EcDos heme pocket, relatively low Fe-O2 (562 cm-1) and N-O (1576 cm-1) stretching frequencies indicated that strong polar interactions with that heme distal pocket are possible for highly bent ligands such as O2 or NO. None of the newly studied NO adducts exhibited evidence of the Fe-His rupture and pentacoordination previously noted for Sinorhizobium meliloti FixL. A low Fe-His stretching frequency, formerly interpreted as a strained Fe-His bond, and the slow association of O2 with S. meliloti FixL failed to correlate with the newly studied proteins having low association rate or low equilibrium association constants for binding of O2. We conclude that although heme-PASs share some features, they represent distinct signal transduction mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This report presents evidence for interdomain steps of the ligand-coupled signal transduction mechanism of the oxygen receptor from Rhizobium meliloti, RmFixL. Photolysis of the CO adducts of heme domain (RmFixLN) and heme kinase (RmFixL*) proteins allowed tracking of second-order heme CO recombination reactions by transient absorbance. Whereas CO rebinding to RmFixLN is characterized by a single kinetic phase, rebinding to RmFixL* is characterized by two kinetic phases. Evidence indicates that CO rebinds to two interconvertible deoxyRmFixL* conformers that are produced sequentially after photolysis. Since the second conformer is only observed when the kinase domain is present, its production is concluded to be an interdomain signal transmission event that is coupled to heme ligand release. Because receptor clustering is a recurring theme in signal transduction mechanisms, the dependence of molecular weight upon heme ligation was investigated at equilibrium. Gel permeation chromatography and native gel electrophoresis showed that the molecular weight distribution for both RmFixLN and RmFixL* depends on heme ligation. At equilibrium, oxyRmFixLN and oxyRmFixL* exist as monomers and dimers, respectively. Their deoxy analogues, metRmFixLN and metRmFixL*, exist as dimers and as a mixture of tetramers and 9-mers, respectively. Assembly of these oligomers is reversible. The physiological relevance of these ligand-coupled assemblies and the kinetic factors controlling CO recombination are discussed.},

The N-terminal PAS domain of FixL contains a histidine-coordinated heme and regulates the activity of its effector domain, a C-terminal histidine kinase, in response to binding of oxygen and other ligands at the heme. To further investigate ligand-induced inhibition of FixL, we have determined the crystal structures of the heme domain in both the deoxy state and bound to carbon monoxide, a weak inhibitor of FixL kinase activity. Structures collected at room temperature are presented in each state from two crystallographic space groups at 1.8 and 2 Å resolution. These structures reveal displacement of the residues of the Hβ and Iβ strands by Leu236 upon CO binding, and this structural change propagates more than 15 Å to a region of the structure implicated in signal transduction in PAS proteins. Displacement of residues Ile215, Ile216, and Gly217 in the FG loop is also evident, accompanied by the movement of heme propionate 6 upon change in iron ligation. CO binding increases the temperature factors in the FG loop of the protein and disorders the side chain of Arg206, a conserved residue involved in the FG loop switch mechanism. We relate these results to structural changes in other PAS sensor domains and their involvement in catalytic control. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

AI-2 signal transduction in V. harveyi requires the integral membrane receptor LuxPQ, comprised of periplasmic binding protein (LuxP) and histidine sensor kinase (LuxQ) subunits. Combined X-ray crystallographic and functional studies show that AI-2 binding causes a major conformational change within LuxP, which in turn stabilizes a quaternary arrangement in which two LuxPQ monomers are asymmetrically associated. We propose that formation of this asymmetric quaternary structure is responsible for repressing the kinase activity of both LuxQ subunits and triggering the transition of V. harveyi into quorum-sensing mode. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a promiscuous bHLH-PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) protein that forms heterodimeric transcriptional regulator complexes with several other bHLH-PAS subunits to control a variety of biological pathways, some of which are centrally involved in disease initiation and/or progression. One of these is the hypoxia response pathway, which allows eukaryotic cells to respond to low oxygen tension via the formation of a heterodimeric complex between ARNT and another bHLH-PAS protein, the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-α). We have previously shown that the C-terminal PAS domains of an HIF-α isoform (HIF-2α) and ARNT interact in vitro, and that mutations in the solvent-exposed β-sheet surface of the HIF-2α domain not only disrupt this interaction, but also greatly attenuate the hypoxia response in living cells. Here, we have solved the solution structure of the corresponding PAS domain of ARNT and show that it utilizes a very similar interface for the interaction with the HIF-2α PAS domain. We also show that this domain self-associates in a concentration- dependent manner, and that the interface used in this homodimeric complex is very similar to that used in the formation of heterodimer. In addition, using experimentally derived NMR restraints, we used the program HADDOCK to calculate a low-resolution model of the complex formed in solution by these two PAS domains, and confirm the validity of this model using site-directed spin labeling to obtain long-range distance information in solution. With this information, we propose a model for the mode of multi-PAS domain interaction in bHLH-PAS transcriptional activation complexes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We introduce a new definition for the reorganization of EENs upon activation that depends on the relative change in rates of energy transfer across noncovalent contacts throughout the protein. On the basis of the reorganized network that we obtain for β2AR upon activation, we identify a branched pathway between the agonist binding site and the cytoplasmic region, where a G-protein binds to the receptor when activated. The pathway includes all of the motifs containing molecular switches previously identified as contributing to the allosteric transition of β2AR upon agonist binding. EENs and their reorganization upon activation are compared with structure-based contact networks computed for the inactive and active states of β2AR.},

In this paper we present software which collects an ensemble of (network) methods tailored towards the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and/or interactions of proteins with ligands of other type, e.g. nucleic acids, oligosaccharides etc. In parallel, we propose the use of the network differential analysis as a method to identify residues mediating key interactions between proteins. We use a model system, to show that in combination with other, already published methods, also included in pyProGA, it can be used to make such predictions. Such extended repertoire of methods allows to cross-check predictions with other methods as well, as we show here. In addition, the possibility to construct PRN models from various kinds of input is so far a unique asset of our code.

Upon photoexcitation, a large amount of excess vibrational energy is selectively deposited on heme due to extremely fast internal conversion. This excess energy is redistributed to the surrounding protein moiety and then to water. Vibrational energy flow in myoglobin (Mb) was examined using picosecond time-resolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy. We used the Trp residue directly contacting the heme group as a selective probe for vibrationally excited populations. Trp residues were placed at different position close to the heme by site-directed mutagenesis. This technique allows us to monitor the excess energy on residue-to-residue basis. Anti-Stokes UVRR measurements for Mb mutants suggest that the dominant channel for energy transfer in Mb is the pathway through atomic contacts between heme and nearby amino acid residues as well as that between the protein and solvent water. It is found that energy flow through proteins is analogous to collisional exchange processes in solutions.},

	abstract = {Background: Biological evolution conserves protein residues that are important for structure and function. Both protein stability and function often require a certain degree of structural co-operativity between spatially neighboring residues and it has previously been shown that conserved residues occur clustered together in protein tertiary structures, enzyme active sites and protein-DNA interfaces. Residues comprising protein interfaces are often more conserved compared to those occurring elsewhere on the protein surface. We investigate the extent to which conserved residues within protein-protein interfaces are clustered together in three-dimensions.Results: Out of 121 and 392 interfaces in homodimers and heterocomplexes, 96.7 and 86.7\%, respectively, have the conserved positions clustered within the overall interface region. The significance of this clustering was established in comparison to what is seen for the subsets of the same size of randomly selected residues from the interface. Conserved residues occurring in larger interfaces could often be sub-divided into two or more distinct sub-clusters. These structural cluster(s) comprising conserved residues indicate functionally important regions within the protein-protein interface that can be targeted for further structural and energetic analysis by experimental scanning mutagenesis. Almost 60\% of experimental hot spot residues (with ΔΔG ¿ 2 kcal/mol) were localized to these conserved residue clusters. An analysis of the residue types that are enriched within these conserved subsets compared to the overall interface showed that hydrophobic and aromatic residues are favored, but charged residues (both positive and negative) are less common. The potential use of this method for discriminating binding sites (interfaces) versus random surface patches was explored by comparing the clustering of conserved residues within each of these regions - in about 50\% cases the true interface is ranked among the top 10\% of all surface patches.Conclusions: Protein-protein interaction sites are much larger than small molecule biding sites, but still conserved residues are not randomly distributed over the whole interface and are distinctly clustered. The clustered nature of evolutionarily conserved residues within interfaces as compared to those within other surface patches not involved in binding has important implications for the identification of protein-protein binding sites and would have applications in docking studies. © 2010 Guharoy and Chakrabarti; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {FixL is a multiple-domain bacterial O2-sensing protein that modulates the activity of its kinase domain in response to O2 concentration. The kinase activity is coupled, via phosphoryl transfer, to transcriptional activation by a response-regulating protein, FixJ. Heme ligation resulting in a transition from high to low spin inhibits the kinase through an, as yet, ill-defined mechanism. This report presents spectroscopic, kinetic, and thermodynamic data on various complexes of two deletion derivatives of Rhizobium meliloti FixL, FixLN (the heme domain) and a functional heme kinase, FixL*. Resonance Raman characterization of metFixLN and metFixL* indicates that the heme core is smaller than that observed in metmyoglobin and is indicative of a five-coordinate high-spin heme in metFixLs. Resonance Raman spectra of FixL-CO adducts reveal that the Fe-C=O unit and/or its electrostatic environment in FixL*-CO is distorted relative to that in FixLN-CO. The 1H NMR spectra of the met forms further support the model of an asymmetric perturbation of the heme pocket structure associated with the presence of the kinase domain in FixL*. Observation of equivalent Fe- imidazole stretching vibrations for deoxyFixLN and deoxyFixL* (212 cm-1) indicates that the source of this perturbation in the heme pocket of FixL* does not lie on the proximal side of the heme. The equivalent Fe-imidazole stretching frequencies for deoxyFixLN and FixL* indicate that the presence of the kinase domain does not alter the relative strength of the proximal Fe- imidazole bond and that the proximal imidazole ligand is weakly H-bonded, probably to a backbone carbonyl group. Kinetic and thermodynamic data for the reactions of cyanide and fluoride ions with FixL are consistent with shape selectivity due to steric and/or an anisotropic electrostatic field in the distal heme pocket being responsible for the unique reactivities (or lack thereof) of FixL with ligands, i.e., O2, CO, CN-, F-, N3-, and SCN-. While the rate constants for binding of CN- to metFixLN and metFixL* are an order of magnitude slower than that for metMb, the stabilities of these complexes and metMb-CN are nearly the same. Neither N3- nor SCN- binds to the heme with measurable affinity. Since other ferric heme proteins forth stable adducts with these ligands, the inability of FixL to form analogous complexes suggests that the ligand selectivity of this protein is rooted in insurmountable activation barriers to the binding of ligands containing more than two atoms and for ligands whose lowest-energy coordination geometries are linear. This allows the natural O2 ligand to compete kinetically with other naturally occurring ligands that form stable complexes with unencumbered hemes. Moreover, the rate constant for binding of CN- to the functional heme-kinase (metFixL*) is smaller than its metFixLN counterpart and the stability of metFixL*-CN is measurably lower than that of metFixLN- CN. This indicates that the contacts between the heme and kinase domains of FixL* impose more stringent geometric constraints on ligand binding than FixLN. The kinase is thus implicated in a possible mechanism for phosphate- dependent feedback control over ligand affinity of the heme.},

Structural comparison of heme-free PefR, its complex with a target DNA, and heme-bound PefR revealed that unique heme coordination controls a ¿20 Å structural rearrangement of the DNA binding domains to dissociate PefR from the target DNA.

	abstract = {FixL is a heme-based oxygen-sensing histidine kinase that induces the expression of nitrogen fixation genes under hypoxic conditions. Oxygen dissociation from heme iron in the sensor domain of FixL initiates protein conformational changes that are transmitted to the histidine kinase domain, activating autophosphorylation activity. Conversely, oxygen binding inhibits FixL kinase activity. It is essential to elucidate the changes that occur in the protein structure upon this oxygen dissociation for understanding of the allosteric transduction mechanism. We measured ultraviolet resonance Raman spectra of FixL and its mutants for deoxy, oxy, and carbonmonoxy forms to examine the changes in protein structure upon oxygen dissociation. The observed spectral changes indicated that Tyr201 and its neighboring residues undergo structural changes upon oxygen dissociation. Kinase assays showed that substitution of Tyr201 significantly decreased the inhibition of kinase activity upon oxygen binding. These data mean that weakening of the hydrogen bond of Tyr201 that is induced by oxygen dissociation is essential for inhibition of kinase activity. We also observed spectral changes in Tyr residues in the kinase domain upon oxygen dissociation from FixL, which is the first observation of oxygen-dependent structural changes in the kinase domain of FixL.

Signal transduction is initiated by the binding of O2 to the heme domain of BjFixL, resulting in protein conformational changes that are transmitted to a histidine kinase domain. We report structural changes of the heme and its binding pocket in the FeII deoxy and FeIII met states of the wild-type BjFixLH oxygen sensor domain and four mutants of the highly conserved residue arginine 220. UV-visible, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopies all showed that the heme iron of the R220H mutant is unexpectedly six-coordinated at physiological pH in the FeIII state but undergoes pH- and redox-dependent coordination changes. This behavior is unprecedented for FixL proteins, but is reminiscent of another oxygen sensor from E. coli, EcDos. All mutants in their deoxy states are five-coordinated FeII, although we report rupture of the residue 220-propionate 7 interaction and structural modifications of the heme conformation as well as propionate geometry and flexibility. In this work, we conclude that part of the structural reorganization usually attributed to O2 binding in the wild-type protein is in fact due to rupture of the Arg220-P7 interaction. Moreover, we correlate the structural modifications of the deoxy FeII states with on values and conclude that the Arg220-P7 interaction is responsible for the lower O2 and CO k on values reported for the wild-type protein. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL is a modular oxygen sensor that directs adaptations to hypoxia by coupling the status of a heme-binding domain to a histidine-protein kinase activity. The oxygen-bound form is the "off-state". The unliganded form is the "on-state" active kinase that phosphorylates a transcription factor, FixJ. We have developed methods to optimize the kinase reactions of FixL and measure the turnover rates (kcat) for reactions catalyzed by highly inhibited states of this sensor at constant, precisely known oxygen saturations. The resulting oxygen dose-response curve shows that an in vitro system with FixL and the response regulator FixJ as its only proteins manifests such a sharp ligand response that, when the proportion of deoxy-FixL decreases less than 3-fold, the kinase activity drops over 50-fold, and by the time the deoxy-FixL declines just 8-fold, the activity is inhibited over 1100-fold. This response is entirely reversible and similar to that reported for the in vivo hypoxic induction of FixLJ-regulated genes. FixL binds oxygen noncooperatively. When complexed with FixJ, FixL is dimeric in both oxy and deoxy states. Therefore traditional models involving cooperative binding of ligand or robust allosteric regulation cannot account for the extremely nonlinear kinase response to the heme saturation. This response, however, can be explained by a form of enzyme hysteresis with the simple assumptions that (i) on association of oxygen with the heme, the kinase is rapidly switched off; (ii) after dissociation of oxygen, the kinase remains inhibited longer than the average time that it takes a deoxy-heme to encounter an oxygen molecule at most oxygen saturations. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

For HbI, water-protein interactions, long known to contribute to the thermodynamics of cooperativity, are seen to influence the dynamics of the protein not only around the protein-water interface but also into the core of each globule, where dynamic and entropic changes upon ligand binding are coupled to protein-water contact dynamics. Similarly, hydration waters trapped deep inside the core region of A2AAR enable the formation of an allosteric network made of water-mediated inter-residue contacts.

We apply LRMT to the calculation of the rate of cyclohexane ring inversion, and compare with experiment and isomerization rates of other similar-sized organic molecules. Our second aim explores the nature of thermal transport in macromolecules, such as proteins, and clusters of molecules. We compute thermal transport coefficients for a cluster of about 1000 water molecules and for the protein myoglobin. Calculation of thermal transport in proteins must address both the anomalous subdiffusion of vibrational energy in proteins and the presence of numerous thermally accessible localized vibrational modes from which energy is transported by anharmonic decay. A new theory for the calculation of thermal transport coefficients in proteins is presented, which is based on and develops further the theory of thermal conduction in fractal objects.},

	abstract = {FixL from Bradyrhizobium japonicum is a PAS sensor protein in which two PAS domains covalently linked to a histidine kinase domain are responsible for regulating nitrogen fixation in an oxygen-dependent manner. The more C-terminal PAS domain, denoted bjFixLH, contains a heme cofactor that binds diatomic molecules such as carbon monoxide and oxygen and regulates the activity of the FixL histidine kinase as part of a two-component signaling system. We present the structures of ferric, deoxy, and carbon monoxide-bound bjFixLH in a new space group (P1) and at resolutions (1.5-1.8 Å) higher than the resolutions of those previously obtained. Interestingly, bjFixLH can form two different dimers (in P1 and R32 crystal forms) in the same crystallization solution, where the monomers in one dimer are rotated ∼175° relative to the second. This suggests that PAS monomers are plastic and that two quite distinct quaternary structures are closely similar in free energy. We use screw rotation analysis to carry out a quantitative pairwise comparison of PAS quaternary structures, which identifies five different relative orientations adopted by isolated PAS monomers. We conclude that PAS monomer arrangement is context-dependent and could differ depending on whether the PAS domains are isolated or are part of a full-length protein. Structurally homologous residues comprise a conserved dimer interface. Using network analysis, we find that the architecture of the PAS dimer interface is continuous rather than modular; the network of residues comprising the interface is strongly connected. A continuous dimer interface is consistent with the low dimer-monomer dissociation equilibrium constant. Finally, we quantitate quaternary structural changes induced by carbon monoxide binding to a bjFixLH dimer, in which monomers rotate by up to ∼2° relative to each other. We relate these changes to those in other dimeric PAS domains and discuss the role of quaternary structural changes in the signaling mechanisms of PAS sensor proteins. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The active form of E. coli Ia RNR is composed of two homodimers that form the active α2β2 complex. Catalysis is initiated by long-range radical translocation over a ∼32 Å proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway involving Y356β and Y731α at the interface. Resolving the PCET pathway at the α/β interface has been a long-standing challenge due to the lack of structural data. Herein, molecular dynamics simulations based on a recently solved cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of an active α2β2 complex are performed to examine the structure and fluctuations of interfacial water, as well as the hydrogen-bonding interactions and conformational motions of interfacial residues along the PCET pathway. Our free energy simulations reveal that Y731 is able to sample both a flipped-out conformation, where it points toward the interface to facilitate interfacial PCET with Y356, and a stacked conformation with Y730 to enable collinear PCET with this residue. Y356 and Y731 exhibit hydrogen-bonding interactions with interfacial water molecules and, in some conformations, share a bridging water molecule, suggesting that the primary proton acceptor for PCET from Y356 and from Y731 is interfacial water. The conformational flexibility of Y731 and the hydrogen-bonding interactions of both Y731 and Y356 with interfacial water and hydrogen-bonded water chains appear critical for effective radical translocation along the PCET pathway. These simulations are consistent with biochemical and spectroscopic data and provide previously unattainable atomic-level insights into the fundamental mechanism of RNR.},

A previously calculated quantum-chemical heme-ligand potential-energy surface together with a three-center charge model for the iron-ligand center that captures both polarization and ligand-to-metal charge transfer allows for a detailed description of the interactions around the active site. It is found that the CN binding orientation (Fe-CN or Fe-NC) to the heme affects the stretching frequency of the ligand, with a 25 cm-1 difference in the fundamental wavenumber between the two orientations as well as a change in bond length. The charge model also captures such crucial interactions as the possible hydrogen bond between the ligand and the His64 residue. This interaction is weakened when the ligand binds in the Fe-NC conformation but is also sensitive to the protonation state of His64. The structural changes around the active site, the observation of water penetration for the Fe-NC conformation, the computed IR spectrum, and the energetics suggest that the Fe-CN conformation with His64 is the most likely one. The water accessibility of the active site is also found to be related to the protonation state of His64. The presence of water in the active site could also affect the IR band of the C-N stretch mode. Thus, IR spectroscopy of the C-N stretch is a potentially useful reporter of ligand isomers and active-site structure. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA.},

Here, we aimed to investigate the performance of residue centrality, viewed as a family fold characteristic, in identifying functionally important residues in protein families. Our study is based on 46 families, including 29 enzyme and 17 non-enzyme families. A total of 80\% of these central positions corresponded to active site residues or residues in direct contact with these sites. For enzyme families, this percentage increased to 91\%, while for non-enzyme families the percentage decreased substantially to 48\%. A total of 70\% of these central positions are located in catalytic sites in the enzyme families, 64\% are in hetero-atom binding sites in those families binding hetero-atoms, and only 16\% belong to protein-protein interfaces in families with protein-protein interaction data. These differences reflect the active site shape: enzyme active sites locate in surface clefts, hetero-atom binding residues are in deep cavities, while protein-protein interactions involve a more planar configuration. On the other hand, not all surface cavities or clefts are comprised of central residues. Thus, closeness centrality identifies functionally important residues in enzymes. While here we focus on binding sites, we expect to identify key residues for the integration and transmission of the information to the rest of the protein, reflecting the relationship between fold and function. Residue centrality is more conserved than the protein sequence, emphasizing the robustness of protein structures.},

We find an unexpected convergence: the three pathways behave in some physiological contexts as linear signal transmitters. Testing the results experimentally, we present direct measurements of linear input-output behavior in the Wnt and ERK pathways. Analytics from each model further reveal that linearity arises through different means in each pathway, which we tested experimentally in the Wnt and ERK pathways. Linearity is a desired property in engineering where it facilitates fidelity and superposition in signal transmission.

Histidine kinases and response regulators have an intrinsic modularity that separates signal input, phosphotransfer, and output response; this modularity has allowed bacteria to dramatically expand and diversify their signaling capabilities. Recent work has begun to reveal the molecular basis by which two-component proteins evolve. How and why do orthologous signaling proteins diverge?

	abstract = {Two-component systems, composed of a homodimeric histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), are major signal transduction devices in bacteria. Typically the signal triggers HK autophosphorylation at one His residue, followed by phosphoryl transfer from the phospho-His to an Asp residue in the RR. Signal extinction frequently involves phospho-RR dephosphorylation by a phosphatase activity of the HK. Our understanding of these reactions and of the determinants of partner specificity among HK-RR couples has been greatly increased by recent crystal structures and biochemical experiments on HK-RR complexes. Cis-autophosphorylation (one subunit phosphorylates itself) occurs in some HKs while trans-autophosphorylation takes place in others. We review and integrate this new information, discuss the mechanism of the three reactions and propose a model for transmembrane signaling by these systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {FixL is a ferrous heme protein whose kinase activity is inhibited by oxygen. Here we show that met-FixL, which is the ferric unliganded form, has the same activity as deoxy-FixL, the ferrous unliganded form, indicating that activity does not depend on the oxidation state of the heme iron. The ferric derivative fluoro-FixL is fully active, indicating that the presence of a heme ligand is not sufficient to cause kinase inhibition. An inverse relation between the rate of autophosphorylation of ferric FixL and the fractional saturation with cyanide shows that the cyanomet form has zero activity. All our active derivatives were high-spin, while our inactive derivatives were low-spin. In mixtures of high- and low-spin FixL, resulting from partial saturation with low-spin ligands, the activity was that which would be expected for the concentration of the high-spin component alone. Therefore the spin state of the heme iron rather than the oxidation state or presence of ligands must be the factor that controls FixL's kinase activity. On transition from low to high spin, the heme iron moves out of the porphyrin plane by 0.4 Å. We propose that, as in hemoglobin, this motion triggers a long-range conformational change which in FixL is responsible for a switch to an active form. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {The mechanical heterogeneity of biomolecular structures is intimately linked to their diverse biological functions. Applying rigidity theory to biomolecules identifies this heterogeneous composition of flexible and rigid regions, which can aid in the understanding of biomolecular stability and long-ranged information transfer through biomolecules, and yield valuable information for rational drug design and protein engineering. We review fundamental concepts in rigidity theory, ways to represent biomolecules as constraint networks, and methodological and algorithmic developments for analyzing such networks and linking the results to biomolecular function. Software packages for performing rigidity analyses on biomolecules in an efficient, automated way are described, as are rigidity analyses on biomolecules including the ribosome, viruses, or transmembrane proteins. The analyses address questions of allosteric mechanisms, mutation effects on (thermo-)stability, protein (un-)folding, and coarse-graining of biomolecules. We advocate that the application of rigidity theory to biomolecules has matured in such a way that it could be broadly applied as a computational biophysical method to scrutinize biomolecular function from a structure-based point of view and to complement approaches focused on biomolecular dynamics. We discuss possibilities to improve constraint network representations and to perform large-scale and prospective studies. WIREs Comput Mol Sci 2017, 7:e1311. doi: 10.1002/wcms.1311.

	abstract = {Background: We initiate in silico rigidity-theoretical studies of biological assemblies and small crystals for protein structures. The goal is to determine if, and how, the interactions among neighboring cells and subchains affect the flexibility of a molecule in its crystallized state. We use experimental X-ray crystallography data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The analysis relies on an effcient graph-based algorithm. Computational experiments were performed using new protein rigidity analysis tools available in the new release of our KINARI-Web server http:// kinari.cs.umass.edu. Results: We provide two types of results: on biological assemblies and on crystals. We found that when only isolated subchains are considered, structural and functional information may be missed. Indeed, the rigidity of biological assemblies is sometimes dependent on the count and placement of hydrogen bonds and other interactions among the individual subchains of the biological unit. Similarly, the rigidity of small crystals may be affected by the interactions between atoms belonging to different unit cells. We have analyzed a dataset of approximately 300 proteins, from which we generated 982 crystals (some of which are biological assemblies). We identified two types of behaviors. (a) Some crystals and/or biological assemblies will aggregate into rigid bodies that span multiple unit cells/asymmetric units. Some of them create substantially larger rigid cluster in the crystal/biological assembly form, while in other cases, the aggregation has a smaller effect just at the interface between the units. (b) In other cases, the rigidity properties of the asymmetric units are retained, because the rigid bodies did not combine. We also identified two interesting cases where rigidity analysis may be correlated with the functional behavior of the protein. This type of information, identified here for the first time, depends critically on the ability to create crystals and biological assemblies, and would not have been observed only from the asymmetric unit. For the Ribonuclease A protein (PDB file 5RSA), which is functionally active in the crystallized form, we found that the individual protein and its crystal form retain the flexibility parameters between the two states. In contrast, a derivative of Ribonuclease A (PDB file 9RSA), has no functional activity, and the protein in both the asymmetric and crystalline forms, is very rigid. For the vaccinia virus D13 scaffolding protein (PDB file 3SAQ), which has two biological assemblies, we observed a striking asymmetry in the rigidity cluster decomposition of one of them, which seems implausible, given its symmetry. Upon careful investigation, we tracked the cause to a placement decision by the Reduce software concerning the hydrogen atoms, thus affecting the distribution of certain hydrogen bonds. The surprising result is that the presence or lack of a very few, but critical, hydrogen bonds, can drastically affect the rigid cluster decomposition of the biological assembly.Conclusion: The rigidity analysis of a single asymmetric unit may not accurately reflect the protein's behavior in the tightly packed crystal environment. Using our KINARI software, we demonstrated that additional functional and rigidity information can be gained by analyzing a protein's biological assembly and/or crystal structure. However, performing a larger scale study would be computationally expensive (due to the size of the molecules involved). Overcoming this limitation will require novel mathematical and computational extensions to our software.},

	abstract = {The role of fluctuations in protein thermostability has recently received considerable attention. In the current literature a dualistic picture can be found: thermostability seems to be associated with enhanced rigidity of the protein scaffold in parallel with the reduction of flexible parts of the structure. In contradiction to such arguments it has been shown by experimental studies and computer simulation that thermal tolerance of a protein is not necessarily correlated with the suppression of internal fluctuations and mobility. Both concepts, rigidity and flexibility, are derived from mechanical engineering and represent temporally insensitive features describing static properties, neglecting that relative motion at certain time scales is possible in structurally stable regions of a protein. This suggests that a strict separation of rigid and flexible parts of a protein molecule does not describe the reality correctly. In this work the concepts of mobility/flexibility versus rigidity will be critically reconsidered by taking into account molecular dynamics calculations of heat capacity and conformational entropy, salt bridge networks, electrostatic interactions in folded and unfolded states, and the emerging picture of protein thermostability in view of recently developed network theories. Last, but not least, the influence of high temperature on the active site and activity of enzymes will be considered.},

We show that upon citrate binding, the PAS domain contracts, resulting in a shortening of the C-terminal β-strand. We demonstrate that this contraction of the PAS domain, which is well characterized for the isolated domain, is the signal transmitted to the transmembrane (TM) helices in a CitA construct in liposomes. Putting the extracytoplasmic PAS domain into context of the membrane-embedded CitA construct slows down citrate-binding kinetics by at least a factor of 60, confirming that TM helix motions are linked to the citrate-binding event. Our results are confirmation of a hallmark of the HK signal transduction mechanism with atomic resolution on a full-length construct lacking only the kinase core domain.},

In the bacterial kingdom, PAS domains are commonly positioned at the amino terminus of signaling proteins such as sensor histidine kinases, cyclic-di-GMP synthases/hydrolases, and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. Although these domains are highly divergent at the primary sequence level, the structures of dozens of PAS domains across a broad section of sequence space have been solved, revealing a conserved three-dimensional architecture. An all-versus-all alignment of 63 PAS structures demonstrates that the PAS domain family forms structural clades on the basis of two principal variables: (a) topological location inside or outside the plasma membrane and (b) the class of small molecule that they bind. The binding of a chemically diverse range of small-molecule metabolites is a hallmark of the PAS domain family. PAS ligand binding either functions as a primary cue to initiate a cellular signaling response or provides the domain with the capacity to respond to secondary physical or chemical signals such as gas molecules, redox potential, or photons.

Transduction of redox signals may be a common mechanistic theme in many different PAS domains. PAS proteins are always located intracellularly but may monitor the external as well as the internal environment. One way in which prokaryotic PAS proteins sense the environment is by detecting changes in the electron transport system. This serves as an early warning system for any reduction in cellular energy levels. Human PAS proteins include hypoxia-inducible factors and voltage-sensitive ion channels; other PAS proteins are integral components of circadian clocks.

Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the LOV domain of YtvA in its dark and light states. The protein assumes the global fold common to all PAS domains and dimerizes via a hydrophobic interface. Directly C-terminal to the core of the LOV domain, an α-helix extends into the solvent. Light absorption causes formation of a covalent bond between a conserved cysteine residue and atom C(4a) of the FMN ring, which triggers rearrangements throughout the LOV domain. Concomitantly, in the dark and light structures, the two subunits of the dimeric protein rotate relative to each other by 5°. This small quaternary structural change is presumably a component of the mechanism by which the activity of YtvA is regulated in response to light.

Residue Arg143 was changed to Lys and Leu, and residue Asp231 was changed to Ala. Matrix- assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes indicate a mixture of monomers and dimers, with a majority of the enzyme in the monomeric state. In the presence of active site ligands, the wild-type enzyme exists almost exclusively as a dimer, whereas the mutant enzymes show only slightly decreased dissociation constants for the dimerization. Initial rate kinetic studies of the wild-type and mutant enzymes show similar k(cat) and K(m) values for aspartate. However, increases in the K(m) values of GTP and IMP are observed for the mutant.

The approach works very well as shown here for four dimers, where high-level coupled cluster with singles and doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) and density functional theory (DFT) Swart-Sola `-Bickelhaupt functional including Grimme’s dispersion correction (SSB-D) reference data are available for comparison.

These latter systems had previously been used to criticize Thole’s damped point-dipole method, but here we show that with the correct use of the method, it is perfectly able to describe the intermolecular interactions.

Static structural studies have suggested an important role of the conserved residue arginine 220 in signal transmission at the level of the heme domain. To assess the role of this residue in the dynamics and properties of the initial intermediates in ligand release, we have investigated the effects of R220X (X = I, Q, E, H, or A) mutations in the FixLH heme domain on the dynamics and spectral properties of the heme upon photolysis of O2, NO, and CO using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Comparison of transient spectra for CO and NO dissociation with steady-state spectra indicated less strain on the heme in the ligand dissociation species for all mutants compared to the wild type (WT). For CO and NO, the kinetics were similar to those of the wild type, with the exception of (1) a relatively low yield of picosecond NO rebinding to R220A, presumably related to the increase in the free volume of the heme pocket, and (2) substantial pH-dependent picosecond to nanosecond rebinding of CO to R220H, related to formation of a hydrogen bond between CO and histidine 220. Upon excitation of the complex bound with the physiological sensor ligand O2, a 5-8 ps decay phase and a nondecaying (¿4 ns) phase were observed for WT and all mutants. The strong distortion of the spectrum associated with the decay phase in WT is substantially diminished in all mutant proteins, indicating an R220-induced role of the heme in the primary intermediate in signal transmission. Furthermore, the yield of dissociated oxygen after this phase (∼10\% in WT) is increased in all mutants, up to almost unity in R220A, indicating a key role of R220 in caging the oxygen near the heme through hydrogen bonding. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these findings and suggest motions of O2 and arginine 220 away from the heme pocket as a second step in the signal pathway on the 50 ps time scale. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Modulation of the charges on the amino acids, e.g., by pH and by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, have significant effects such as protein denaturation and switch-like response of signal transduction networks. This review aims to present a unifying theme among the various effects of protein charges and polar groups. Simple models will be used to illustrate basic ideas about electrostatic interactions in proteins, and these ideas in turn will be used to elucidate the roles of electrostatic interactions in protein structure, folding, binding, condensation, and related biological functions. In particular, we will examine how charged side chains are spatially distributed in various types of proteins and how electrostatic interactions affect thermodynamic and kinetic properties of proteins. Our hope is to capture both important historical developments and recent experimental and theoretical advances in quantifying electrostatic contributions of proteins.},

The results confirm our previous finding with a local functional that the Fe(II)CO unit is significantly deformable with respect to tilting and bending. This deformability stems in large part from a large, negative interaction constant between the FeC tilt and FeCO bend coordinates. The Fe(III)CN unit is also significantly deformable, but in this case the deformability results from a very small Fe(III)CN bend force constant and the ability of the cyano nitrogen to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The prediction that the energetic penalty associated with deforming the Fe(II)CO unit is relatively modest indicates that such deformations are unlikely to be the dominant contributor to myoglobin's discrimation against CO in favor of O2.},

In each of these chimeric proteins (CskA254, CskA264, CskA274, CskA284, and CskA294), the sensor domain of heme-based O2 sensor FixL, obtained from Sinorhizobium meliloti, was fused with the histidine kinase domain from a hyperthermophile, Thermotoga maritima, each at a systematically different position. The UV-visible (UV-vis), resonance Raman (RR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectral characteristics of the CskAs indicated that the secondary and heme environmental structures of all five CskAs examined are identical to those of FixL. In spite of these structural similarities, all CskAs did not exhibit O2-dependent regulation of autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, their functional properties were much different from those of FixL: The O 2 binding affinity and the autophosphorylation activity for CskA254, CskA264, and CskA274 were similar to those of the truncated sensor and histidine kinase domain, whereas CskA284 and CskA294 display extremely low O2 affinity and low autophosphorylation activity, as compared with each truncated domain. These observations indicated that the interdomain interaction was presented in those CskAs, and that interaction could be related to the O2-dependent regulatory interaction of FixL. In the present study, we demonstrated that the interaction in the physiological sensor histidine kinase would be strictly and finely controlled to mediate the signal ligation-dependent autophosphorylation activity in its histidine kinase domain. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results indicate that the zwitterion can be formed in all considered solvents except chloroform. For two pairs of solvents (methanol and monoethanolamine, propylamine and chloroform) with similar dielectric constant but different hydrogen bond capacity, the solvents with higher hydrogen bond capacity (monoethanolamine and propylamine) facilitate the zwitterion formation. More importantly, kinetics parameters such as activation free energy for the zwitterion formation are more relevant to the hydrogen bond capacity than to dielectric constant of the considered solvents, clarifying the hydrogen bond capacity could be more important than dielectric constant in determining the kinetics of monoethanolamine with CO2.},

Using crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational methods, we have captured and studied a catalytic IPC intermediate in the active site of an enzyme derived from thermostable Rhodothermus marinus (Rma) cytochrome c. High-resolution crystal structures and computational methods reveal how directed evolution created an active site for carbene transfer in an electron transfer protein and how the laboratory-evolved enzyme achieves perfect carbene transfer stereoselectivity by holding the catalytic IPC in a single orientation. We also discovered that the IPC in Rma cytochrome c has a singlet ground electronic state and that the protein environment uses geometrical constraints and noncovalent interactions to influence different IPC electronic states. This information helps us to understand the impressive reactivity and selectivity of carbene transfer enzymes and offers insights that will guide and inspire future engineering efforts.},

	abstract = {The rhizobial FixL/FixJ system, a paradigm of heme-based oxygen sensors, belongs to the ubiquitous two-component signal transduction system. Oxygen-free (deoxy) FixL is autophosphorylated at an invariant histidine residue by using ATP and catalyzes the concomitant phosphoryl transfer to FixJ, but oxygen binding to the FixL heme moiety inactivates the kinase activity. Here we demonstrate that ADP acts as an allosteric effector, reducing the oxygen-binding affinity of the sensor domain in FixL when it is produced from ATP in the kinase reaction. The addition of ADP to a solution of purified wild-type FixL resulted in an ≈4- to 5-fold decrease in oxygen-binding affinity in the presence of FixJ. In contrast, phosphorylation-deficient mutants, in which the well conserved ATP-binding catalytic site of the kinase domain is impaired, showed no such allosteric effect. This discovery casts light on the significance of homodimerization of two-component histidine kinases; ADP, generated in the phosphorylation reaction in one subunit of the homodimer, enhances the histidine kinase activity of the other, analogous to a two-cylinder reciprocating engine by reducing the ligand-binding affinity.},

In this study, mutants of the heme distal Arg200, Arg208, Ile209, Ile210, and Arg214 residues of SmFixL were characterized biochemically and physicochemically, because it has been suggested that they are significant residues in ligand-linked kinase regulation. Measurements of the autoxidation rate, affinities, and kinetics of ligand binding revealed that all of the above residues are involved in stabilization of the O2-heme complex of FixL. However, Arg214 was found to be the only residue that is directly relevant to the ligand-dependent regulation of kinase activity. Although the wild type and R214K and R214Q mutants exhibited normal kinase regulation, R214A, R214M, R214H, and R214Y did not. 13C and 15N NMR analyses for 13C15N- bound to the truncated heme domains of the Arg214 mutants indicated that, in the wild type and the foregoing two mutants, the heme moiety is present in a single conformation, but in the latter four, the conformations fluctuate possibly because of the lack of an interaction between the iron-bound ligand and residue 214. It is likely that such a rigid conformation of the ligand-bound form is important for the downregulation of histidine kinase activity. Furthermore, a comparison of the NMR data between the wild type and R214K and R214Q mutants suggests that a strong electrostatic interaction between residue 214 and the iron-bound ligand is not necessarily required for the single convergent structure and eventually for the downregulation of FixL. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

Oxygen binding to heme iron in the sensor domain of FixL initiates protein conformational changes that are transmitted to the histidine kinase domain, inactivating autophosphorylation activity.

Ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra revealed that oxygen binding to the truncated sensor domain of FixL markedly decreased the intensity of the Y8a band arising from Fα-10 Tyr. In contrast, no appreciable change in intensity of the Y8a band occurred after CO binding, and time-resolved UVRR spectra of the sensor domain of FixL upon O2 dissociation indicated that structural changes near Fα-10 Tyr occurred at ∼0.1 μs. These results suggest that O2 dissociation from FixL changes the protein conformation near the F α-10 Tyr residue within a microsecond. The conformational changes of FixL upon O2 dissociation and the underlying sensing mechanism also are discussed. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The mutation of these residues disrupted the regulation of the kinase activity by the sensor (heme) domain, indicating that Ile209 and Ile210 play important roles in the signal transduction between the heme and the kinase domains. By measurement of the resonance Raman and optical absorption spectra of Ile209 and Ile210 mutants in several oxidation, spin, and ligation states, it was found that both residues are highly flexible, and their side chains sterically interact with the O2 ligand, when it binds to the heine iron.

Based on the structural and spectroscopic analyses, we propose the O2 sensing mechanism that differs from the case proposed in BjFixLH as follows; conformational changes in the F/G loop, which are induced by steric repulsion between the bent-bound O2 and the Ile209 side-chain, would be transmitted to the histidine kinase domain. Interaction between the iron-bound O2 and Ile209 was also observed in the resonance Raman spectra of RmFixLH as evidenced by the fact that the Fe-O2 and Fe-CN stretching frequencies were shifted from 575 to 570 cm-1 (Fe-O2), and 504 to 499 cm-1, respectively, as the result of the replacement of Ile209 with an Ala residue. In the I209A mutant of RmFixL, the O2 sensing activity was destroyed, thus confirming our proposed mechanism. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The new function that can automatically obtain the relevant parameters for zinc, copper, iron, etc., which can be exported in AMBER Frcmod format, has been added.

Distinct differences were observed in the amplitude of the band intensity change between the Trp residues at different positions, and the amplitude of the band intensity change exhibits a correlation with the extent of exposure of the Trp residue to solvent water.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {FixL's are chimeric heme protein kinases from symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia. We have overexpressed three FixL variants in Escherichia coli. Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL, a soluble dimeric protein, is the first full-length FixL to be purified. The other two proteins are soluble truncations of Rhizobium meliloti FixL, which is a membrane protein. One contains both heme and kinase domains and is dimeric; the other has only the heme domain and is monomeric. We find that all the FixL's bind oxygen and carbon monoxide non-cooperatively, with very low affinities due entirely to slow association rates. FixL P50's for oxygen are 17–76 mmHg. FixL's may sense nitric oxide and carbon monoxide in addition to oxygen, especially at the low oxygen pressures encountered in vivo. Autoxidation rates are about 50 times faster than that of sperm whale myoglobin. The carbon monoxide affinity of FixL's is about 300 times lower than that of myoglobin, resulting in the unusually low values of 7.5–17 for the partition constant, M = P50(O2)/P50(CO), between carbon monoxide and oxygen. Met-FixL's have their Soret absorption maximum at 395 nm instead of the typical 408 nm and a steep hydroxymet transition at pH ≥ 9.3; these properties indicate a pentacoordinated high-spin ferric heme and suggest a sterically hindered hydrophobic heme pocket lacking a distal (E7) histidine. FixL is the first member of a new class of heme proteins, the heme-based sensors, distinct from the oxygen carriers and electron transporters. We expect that some of the novel properties of FixL will be characteristic of the class. © 1994, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

We assessed the contributions of this residue in Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL by determining the effects of an R206A substitution on the heme-PAS structure, ligand affinity, and regulatory capacity. The crystal structures of the unliganded forms of the R206A and wild-type BjFixL heme-PAS domains were similar, except for a more ruffled porphyrin ring in R206A BjFixL and a relaxation of the H214 residue and heme propionate 7 due to their lost interactions. The oxygen affinity of R206A BjFixL (Kd∼350 μM) was 2.5 times lower than that of BjFixL, and this was due to a higher off-rate constant for the R206A variant. The enzymatic activities of the unliganded "on-state" forms, either deoxy or met-R206A BjFixL, were comparable to each other and slightly lower (twofold less) than those of the corresponding BjFixL species. The most striking difference between the two proteins was in the enzymatic activities of the liganded "off-state" forms. In particular, saturation with a regulatory ligand (the FeIII form with cyanide) caused a ¿2000-fold inhibition of the BjFixL phosphorylation of BjFixJ, but a 140-fold inhibition of this catalytic activity in R206A BjFixL. Thus, in oxygen-sensing PAS domains, the interactions of polar residues with the heme edge couple the heme-binding domain to a transmitter during signal transduction. © 2006.},

Recent structural studies of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL heme domain (BjFixLH) have suggested an allosteric mechanism that is distinct from the classical hemoglobin model. To gain further insight into the FixL sensing mechanism, structures of BjFixLH bound to dioxygen, imidazole, and nitric oxide have been determined. These structures, particularly the structure of BjFixLH bound to its physiological ligand, dioxygen, have helped to address a number of important issues relevant to the BjFixLH sensing mechanism. On the basis of the oxy-BjFixLH structure, a conserved arginine is found to stabilize the dioxygen ligand in a mode reminiscent of the distal histidine in classical myoglobins and hemoglobins. The structure of BjFixLH bound to imidazole elucidates the structural requirements for accommodating sterically bulky ligands. Finally, the structure of BjFixLH bound to nitric oxide provides evidence for a structural intermediate in the heme-driven conformational change.},

Responses are largely controlled by signal transduction systems that contain two central enzymatic components, a protein kinase that uses adenosine triphosphate to phosphorylate itself at a histidine residue and a response regulator that accepts phosphoryl groups from the kinase. This conserved phosphotransfer chemistry is found in a wide range of bacterial species and operates in diverse systems to provide different regulatory outputs. The histidine kinases are frequently membrane receptor proteins that respond to environmental signals and phosphorylate response regulators that control transcription. Four specific regulatory systems are discussed in detail: chemotaxis in response to attractant and repellent stimuli (Che), regulation of gene expression in response to nitrogen deprivation (Ntr), control of the expression of enzymes and transport systems that assimilate phosphorus (Pho), and regulation of outer membrane porin expression in response to osmolarity and other culture conditions (Omp). Several additional systems are also examined, including systems that control complex developmental processes such as sporulation and fruiting-body formation, systems required for virulent infections of plant or animal host tissues, and systems that regulate transport and metabolism. Finally, an attempt is made to understand how cross-talk between parallel phosphotransfer pathways can provide a global regulatory curcuitry.},

	abstract = {FixL proteins are bacterial heme-containing signal transduction proteins responsible for sensing the O2 concentration in the organism's environment. In Sinorhizobium meliloti FixL is a protein histidine kinase that, together with its response regulator FixJ, constitute an oxygen-sensitive switch for regulation of the organism's nitrogen fixation and microaerobic respiration genes. The O2 sensitivity of the switch is such that it transitions during the process of symbiosis in alfalfa roots. Bradyrhizobium japonicum FixL similarly regulates microaerobic and anaerobic respiration genes during symbiosis in soybean roots. FixLs responds to low oxygen concentrations with increased autophosphorylation activity of their kinase domains. The phosphorylated FixL provides a phosphoryl group to FixJ within a FixLJ complex. The phosphorylated FixJs are transcriptionally active toward their target genes. The FixL kinase domain is inhibited when the heme in FixL is oxygenated. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of ligand binding to both ferrous and ferric FixLs have shown a generally low affinity for ligands relative to myoglobins. These relatively low ligand affinities are attributable almost completely to diminished rates of ligand binding. The heme and its environment in liganded and unliganded FixLs have been characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy, EXAFS, and X-ray crystallography. These studies have revealed that in the purified proteins, the heme is converted from a six-coordinate low spin state to a five-coordinate high spin state upon O 2 release. Comparisons of spectroscopic and structural characteristics of deoxyFixL with oxyFixL, met-FixL-CN, FixL-CO, and FixL-NO complexes indicate that distal affects in the heme pocket are, at least in part, responsible for communicating the ligation state of the heme to the kinase domain. The mechanisms by which ligand binding events are communicated from the heme to the kinase domain involves propagation and/or amplification of the ligation-coupled conformational transitions of the heme and its immediate protein environment. More recently, time-resolved experiments examining the nonequilibrium, ligand-coupled dynamics initiated by O2, CO, and NO photolysis from the corresponding FixL complexes have begun to shed light on the landscape of the switching coordinate. Current thinking and understanding of the mechanism for signal transduction in the FixLJ systems are discussed in the context of these physical investigations. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The FixL heme-based sensor, despite its low affinity for oxygen, is much more reactive than myoglobin toward the large polar ligand imidazole. To determine which features of a myoglobin heme pocket favor binding of imidazole, we have measured binding of this ligand to the FixL heme domain, elephant myoglobin, wild-type sperm whale myoglobin, and sperm whale myoglobins having alanine, valine, threonine, glutamine, leucine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan substitutions of the distal (E7) histidine residue. Except for histidine, the association rate constants dropped more than 3000-fold as the volume of the E7 side chain, at position 64, was expanded from alanine (106 M-1 s-1) to phenylalanine (103 M-1 s-1). There was inhibition of imidazole binding due to displacement of coordinated water from H64 and H64Q sperm whale myoglobins, where the E7 side chain hydrogen bonds directly to the bound ligand. The imidazole dissociation rate constants varied less dramatically and less consistently with any single factor, though they were measurably decreased by hydrogen bonding to an E7 glutamine or histidine. On the whole, the results for the sperm whale myoglobin E7 substitutions show that the rate constants for imidazole binding are useful and sensitive indicators of steric hindrance and polar interactions in the distal pockets of myoglobins. The combined effects of the glutamine 64 and phenylalanine 29 in elephant myoglobin largely account for its increased imidazole association and dissociation rate constants, respectively, compared to those of sperm whale myoglobin. An unhindered distal pocket not competent to stabilize positive poles is indicated by the large imidazole association (≤ 104 M-1 s-1) and dissociation (≤50 s-1) rate constants, parameters that are characteristic of FixL.},

To tackle this problem, we equipped the β-hairpin fold of a tryptophan zipper with pairs of non-canonical amino acids, one serving as a VET injector and one as a VET sensor in a femtosecond pump probe experiment. Accompanying extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations combined with a master equation analysis unravel the VET pathways. Our joint experimental/computational endeavor reveals the efficiency of backbone vs. contact transport, showing that even if cutting short backbone stretches of only 3 to 4 amino acids in a protein, hydrogen bonds are the dominant VET pathway.},

In the isolated R220A BjFixL heme-PAS domain, the iron-histidine bond was increased in length by 0.31 Å, the heme flattened even without a ligand, and the interaction of a presumed regulatory loop (the FG loop) with the helix of heme attachment was weakened. Binding of carbon monoxide was similar for ferrous BjFixL and R220A BjFixL. In contrast, the level of binding of oxygen was dramatically lower (Kd ∼ 1.5 mM) for R220A BjFixL, and this was manifested as 60- and 3-fold lower on- and off-rate constants, respectively. Binding of cyanide followed the same pattern as binding of oxygen. The catalytic activity was 3-4-fold higher in the "on-state" unliganded forms of R220A BjFixL than in the corresponding BjFixL species. Cyanide regulation of this activity was strongly impaired, but some inhibition was nevertheless preserved. Carbon monoxide and nitric oxide regulation, although weak in BjFixL, were abolished from R220A BjFixL. We conclude that the Gβ-2 arginine assists in the binding of oxygen to BjFixL but does not accomplish this by stabilizing the oxy form. This arginine is not absolutely required for regulation, although it is important for shifting a pre-existing kinase equilibrium toward the inactive state on binding of regulatory ligands. These findings support a regulatory model in which the heme-PAS domain operates as an ensemble that couples to the kinase rather than a mechanism driven by a single central switch.},

Oxygen regulates this process by binding reversibly to RmFixL, a heme protein kinase whose deoxy form catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer from ATP to RmFixJ. Here we present the first quantitative measure of the extent by which various heme ligands inhibit the turnover of RmFixJ to phospho-RmFixJ. We also quantitate the inhibition by ligands of the reaction of RmFixL with ATP, in the absence of RmFixJ, to form phospho-RmFixL, i.e., the "autophosphorylation". Phospho-RrnFixL formed from autophosphorylation will transfer its phosphoryl group to RmFixJ in an oxygen-independent "phosphotransfer." Here we show that the mode of substrate presentation, i.e., simultaneous versus sequential, influences the regulation of phosphoryl transfer by heme status. Inhibition factors for O2, CO, NO, CN-, and imidazole in the presence of RmFixJ are drastically different from the inhibition of autophosphorylation by the same ligands. Oxidation of the heme iron in unliganded RmFixL is known to have no effect on either of the sequential reactions; yet oxidation causes a 100-fold decrease in RmFixJ turnover when ATP and RmFixJ are presented simultaneously. The profound difference between the regulation of isolated RmFixL versus the complex of RmFixL with RmFixJ shows that interaction of a response regulator with its histidine-kinase partner need not be limited to the enzymatic regions of the histidine kinase, but can extend also to its sensory domain.},

In comparison to the unliganded ReFixL protein (+ 19 mV), the binding to ligands that switch off the kinase activity induces a negative shift, i. e. Em = − 51, − 57 and − 156 mV for O2, imidazole and CN−, respectively. Upon binding to CO, which does not affect the kinase active, Em was observed at + 21 mV. The potential values observed for FeIII/II of the heme domain of ReFixL upon binding to CO and O2 do not follow the expected trend based on thermodynamics, assuming that positive potential shift would be expected for ligands that bind to and therefore stabilize the FeII state. Our results suggest that the conformational changes that switch off kinase activity upon O2 binding have knock-on effects to the local environment of the heme, such as solvent rearrangement, destabilize the FeII state and counterbalances the FeII-stabilizing influence of the O2 ligand.},

	abstract = {FixL from Rhizobium etli (ReFixL) is a hybrid oxygen sensor protein. Signal transduction in ReFixL is effected by a switch off of the kinase activity on binding of an oxygen molecule to ferrous heme iron in another domain. Cyanide can also inhibit the kinase activity upon binding to the heme iron in the ferric state. The unfolding by urea of the purified full-length ReFixL in both active pentacoordinate form, met-FixL(FeIII) and inactive cyanomet-FixL (FeIII-CN−) form was monitored by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The CD and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy revealed two states during unfolding, whereas fluorescence spectroscopy identified a three-state unfolding mechanism. The unfolding mechanism was not altered for the active compared to the inactive state; however, differences in the ΔGH2O were observed. According to the CD results, compared to cyanomet-FixL, met-FixL was more stable towards chemical denaturation by urea (7.2 vs 4.8 kJ mol− 1). By contrast, electronic spectroscopy monitoring of the Soret band showed cyanomet-FixL to be more stable than met-FixL (18.5 versus 36.2 kJ mol− 1). For the three-state mechanism exhibited by fluorescence, the ΔGH2O for both denaturation steps were higher for the active-state met-FixL than for cyanomet-FixL. The overall stability of met-FixL is higher in comparison to cyanomet-FixL suggesting a more compact protein in the active form. Nonetheless, hydrogen bonding by bound cyanide in the inactive state promotes the stability of the heme domain. This work supports a model of signal transduction by FixL that is likely shared by other heme-based sensors.},
