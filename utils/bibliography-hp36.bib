We begin by presenting theories of heat conduction for general material classes, focusing on common approximations and trends. Next, we discuss characterization techniques for measuring thermal conductivity and the underlying transport properties. Advanced materials at the frontiers of thermal transport, such as rattlers, complex unit cells, nanowires, and nanocomposites, are treated in depth using experimental data and theoretical predictions. The review closes by highlighting several promising areas for further development.},

Also, NAMD incorporates the distributed par allel multipole tree algorithm for full electrostatic force evaluation in O( N) time. NAMD can be connected via a communication system to a molecular graphics program in order to provide an interactive modeling tool for viewing and modifying a running simulation.

  abstract = {Although thermal transport is among the essential biophysical properties of proteins, its relationship with protein structures, dynamics, and functions is still elusive. The structures of folded proteins are highly inhomogeneous, giving rise to an anisotropic and non-uniform flow of thermal energy during conformational fluctuations. To illustrate the nature of proteins, we developed a theoretical framework for analyzing local thermal transport properties based on the autocorrelation function formalism, constructed a linear-homopolymer-like model, and applied it to a small α-helical protein, the villin headpiece subdomain (HP36), using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, the model reproduced the exact value of the protein’s thermal conductivity with an error of less than 1 \%. Interestingly, the site-selective analysis of the local, residue-wise, thermal conductivity demonstrated its distinct residue-type dependence, i.e., its magnitude decreased in the order of charged, polar, and hydrophobic residues. In addition, the local density dependence of the residue-wise thermal transport property was also discussed.}

These carriers are: phonon (lattice vibration wave also treated as quasi-particle), electron (as classical or quantum entity), fluid particle (classical particle with quantum features), and photon (classical electromagnetic wave also as quasi-particle). The approach combines the fundamentals of the following fields: molecular orbitals-potentials, statistical thermodynamics, computational molecular dynamics, quantum energy states, transport theories, solid-state and fluid-state physics, and quantum optics. These are rationally connected to atomic-level heat transfer and thermal energy conversion. This textbook presents a unified theory, over fine-structure/molecular-dynamics/Boltzmann/macroscopic length and time scales, of heat transfer kinetics in terms of transition rates and relaxation times, and modern applications, including nano- and microscale size effects. Numerous examples, illustrations, and homework problems with answers enhance learning},

In heme proteins at room temperature conversion of a 530-nm photon into vibrational energy is estimated to raise the temperature of the heme by 500-700 K. Cooling of the heme is expected to occur mainly by interacting with the surrounding protein. We report molecular dynamics simulations for myoglobin and cytochrome c in vacuo that predict that this cooling occurs on the ps time scale. The decay of the vibrational temperature is nonexponential with about 50\% loss occurring in 1-4 ps and with the remainder in 20-40 ps. These results predict the presence of nonequilibrium vibrational populations that would introduce ambiguity into the interpretation of transient ps absorption and Raman spectra and influence the kinetics of sub-ns geminate recombination.},

By characterizing the dynamic modulation of the protein backbone induced by ligand binding in terms of single residue and pairwise distance fluctuations, we identify a response nucleus modulated by the ligand that is visible only at THz frequencies. The residues of this nucleus undergo a significant stiffening and an increase in mutual coordination upon binding. Additionally, we find that the dynamic modulation is significantly more intense for the side chains, where it is also redistributed to distal regions not immediately in contact with the ligand allowing us to better define the response nucleus at THz frequencies. The overlap between the known allosterically responding residues of the investigated PDZ domains and the modulated region highlighted here suggests that fast THz dynamics could play a role in allosteric mechanisms.},

Heme proteins are highly suitable for studies of the vibrational energy exchanges in proteins. The migration of excess energy released by heme in a protein moiety can be observed using time-resolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy. The anti-Stokes resonance Raman intensity of a tryptophan residue is an excellent probe for the excess energy and the spatial resolution of a single amino acid residue can be achieved. Here, we studied dependence of vibrational energy transfer on the distance in cytochrome b562, which is a heme-containing, four-helix bundle protein. The vibrational energy transfer from the heme group to a single tryptophan residue introduced by site-directed mutagenesis was examined for different heme-tryptophan distances by a quasi-constant length with the periodicity of α helices. Taken together with structural data obtained by molecular dynamics simulations, the energy transfer could be well described by the model of classical thermal diffusion, which suggests that continuum media provide a good approximation of the protein interior, of which the atomic packing density is very high.},

We examined the possible correlation between the closeness centrality measure of amino acids within PCNs and their mobility as known from NMR spin relaxation experiments and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The pivotal observation was that plasticity within a protein stretch correlated inversely to closeness centrality. Effects on protein conformational plasticity caused by the formation of disulfide bonds or protein–protein interactions were also identified by the PCN analysis measure closeness centrality and the hereby introduced percentage of closeness centrality perturbation (\% CCP). All the comparisons between PCN measures, NMR data, and MDs were performed in a set of proteins of different biological functions and structures: the core protease domain of anthrax lethal factor, the N-terminal RING domain of E3 Ub ligase Arkadia, the reduced and oxidized forms of human thioredoxin 1, and the ubiquitin molecules (Ub) of the catalytic Ub–RING–E3–E2–Ub complex of E3 ligase Ark2.The graph theory analysis of PCNs could thus provide a general method for assessing the conformational dynamics of free proteins and putative plasticity changes between different protein forms (apo/complexed or reduced/oxidized).},

            Residue interaction networks (RINs) are used to represent residue contacts in protein structures. Thanks to the advances in network theory, RINs have been proved effective as an alternative to coordinate data in the analysis of complex systems. The RING server calculates high quality and reliable non-covalent molecular interactions based on geometrical parameters. Here, we present the new RING 3.0 version extending the previous functionality in several ways. The underlying software library has been re-engineered to improve speed by an order of magnitude. RING now also supports the mmCIF format and provides typed interactions for the entire PDB chemical component dictionary, including nucleic acids. Moreover, RING now employs probabilistic graphs, where multiple conformations (e.g. NMR or molecular dynamics ensembles) are mapped as weighted edges, opening up new ways to analyze structural data. The web interface has been expanded to include a simultaneous view of the RIN alongside a structure viewer, with both synchronized and clickable. Contact evolution across models (or time) is displayed as a heatmap and can help in the discovery of correlating interaction patterns. The web server, together with an extensive help and tutorial, is available from URL: https://ring.biocomputingup.it/.},

              Thermogenetics is a promising innovative neurostimulation technique, which enables robust activation of neurons using thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels. Broader application of this approach in neuroscience is, however, hindered by a limited variety of suitable ion channels, and by low spatial and temporal resolution of neuronal activation when TRP channels are activated by ambient temperature variations or chemical agonists. Here, we demonstrate rapid, robust and reproducible repeated activation of snake TRPA1 channels heterologously expressed in non-neuronal cells, mouse neurons and zebrafish neurons
              in vivo
              by infrared (IR) laser radiation. A fibre-optic probe that integrates a nitrogen−vacancy (NV) diamond quantum sensor with optical and microwave waveguide delivery enables thermometry with single-cell resolution, allowing neurons to be activated by exceptionally mild heating, thus preventing the damaging effects of excessive heat. The neuronal responses to the activation by IR laser radiation are fully characterized using Ca

              Conformational motions of proteins are necessary for their functions. To date, experimental studies measuring conformational fluctuations of a whole protein structure have revealed that water molecules hydrating proteins are necessary to induce protein functional motions. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism behind such regulation remains unsolved. To clarify the mechanism, multi-domain proteins are good targets because it is obvious that water molecules between domains play an important role in domain motions. Here, we show how changes in hydration structure microscopically correlate with large-amplitude motions of a multi-domain protein, through molecular dynamics simulation supported by structural analyses and biochemical experiments. We first identified collective domain motions of the protein, which open/close an active-site cleft between domains. The analyses on changes in hydration structure revealed that changes in local hydration in the depth of the cleft are necessary for the domain motion and
              vice versa
              . In particular, ‘wetting’/‘drying’ at a hydrophobic pocket and ‘adsorption’/‘dissociation’ of a few water molecules at a hydrophilic crevice in the cleft were induced by dynamic rearrangements of hydrogen-bond networks, and worked as a switch for the domain motions. Our results microscopically demonstrated the importance of hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in understanding energy landscapes of protein motions.},

The proposed method makes it possible to efficiently simulate protein conformational changes caused by either solutions of varying concentrations or the presence of cosolvent species by taking advantage of the LRPF and 3D-RISM. The proposed method is applied to the urea-induced denaturation of ubiquitin. The LRPF/3D-RISM trajectories successfully simulate the early stage of the denaturation process within the simulation time of 300 ns, whereas no significant structural change is observed even in the 1 μs standard MD simulation. The obtained LRPF/3D-RISM trajectories reproduce the mechanism of the urea denaturation of ubiquitin reported in previous studies, and demonstrate the high efficiency of the method.},

In this study, a new reaction intermediate of F1-ATPase was discovered at a temperature below 4°C, which makes a pause at the same angle in its rotation as when ATP binds. The rate constant of the intermediate reaction was strongly dependent on temperature with a Q10 factor of 19, implying that the intermediate reaction accompanies a large conformational change. Kinetic analyses showed that the intermediate state does not correspond to ATP binding or hydrolysis. The addition of ADP to the reaction mixture did not alter the angular position of the intermediate state, but specifically lengthened the time constant of this state. Conversely, the addition of inorganic phosphate caused a pause at an angle of +80° from that of the intermediate state. These observations strongly suggest that the newly found reaction intermediate is an ADP-releasing step.},

ONIOM(QM:MM) reduces the expense of normal mode calculations when computing the majority of second derivatives only at the MM level.

In this work, we examine the energy landscape of protein dynamics in terms of the continuous and discrete water structures that control protein dynamics. We observe that the internal structures at the active site of proteins are constantly shaped by strong interactions with hydration shell and bulk water motions. By describing the energy landscape of proteins in terms of its three component motions; conformational, hydration and protonation, and electronic structure, it is possible to systematically understand protein function.},

The presence and fluctuations of protein hydration water (PHW) largely influence protein motions that are believed to be slaved to those of the solvent, yet to date, how protein and hydration water dynamics are coupled remains unclear. Here, we provide a significant advance in characterizing this coupling; we present the first full study of both the longitudinal and transverse coherent collective motions in a protein–solvent system. The data show unexpectedly the presence in the water dynamics of collective modes belonging to the protein. The properties of these modes, in particular, their propagation velocities and amplitudes, indicate a strengthening of the interactions and a higher rigidity of the network of solvent molecules close to the protein surface. Accordingly, the present study presents the most compelling and clear evidence of a very strong dynamical coupling between a protein and its hydration water, previously suggested by studies using various experimental techniques.},

These local changes alter the electrostatic potential and thus local electrostatic fields, which impacts the dynamics of water molecules close the protein surface. Here we show by a combined computational design, experimental, and molecular dynamics (MD) study that local mutations have not only a local but also a global effect on the solvent: In the specific case of the matrix metalloprotease MMP14, we found that the nature of local mutations, coupled with surface morphology, have the ability to influence large patches of the water hydrogen-bonding network at the protein surface, which is correlated with stability. The solvent contribution can be experimentally probed via terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, thus opening the door to the exciting perspective of rational protein design in which a systematic tuning of hydration water properties allows manipulation of protein stability and enzymatic activity.},

	abstract = {Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of protein adsorption is of essential importance for further development of biotechnology. Here, we use interface-selective nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy to investigate protein charge at the air/water interface by probing the orientation of interfacial water molecules. We measured the Im χ(2) spectra of hemoglobin, myoglobin, serum albumin and lysozyme at the air/water interface in the CH and OH stretching regions using heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) spectroscopy, and we deduced the isoelectric point of the protein by monitoring the orientational flip-flop of water molecules at the interface. Strikingly, our measurements indicate that the isoelectric point of hemoglobin is significantly lowered (by about one pH unit) at the air/water interface compared to that in the bulk. This can be predominantly attributed to the modifications of the protein structure at the air/water interface. Our results also suggest that a similar mechanism accounts for the modification of myoglobin charge at the air/water interface. This effect has not been reported for other model proteins at interfaces probed by conventional VSFG techniques, and it emphasizes the importance of the structural modifications of proteins at the interface, which can drastically affect their charge profiles in a protein-specific manner. The direct experimental approach using HD-VSFG can unveil the changes of the isoelectric point of adsorbed proteins at various interfaces, which is of major relevance to many biological applications and sheds new light on the effect of interfaces on protein charge.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the diffusivity of enzymes increases in a substrate-dependent manner during catalysis. Although this observation has been reported and characterized for several different systems, the precise origin of this phenomenon is unknown. Calorimetric methods are often used to determine enthalpies from enzyme-catalysed reactions and can therefore provide important insight into their reaction mechanisms. The ensemble averages involved in traditional bulk calorimetry cannot probe the transient effects that the energy exchanged in a reaction may have on the catalyst. Here we obtain single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data and analyse them within the framework of a stochastic theory to demonstrate a mechanistic link between the enhanced diffusion of a single enzyme molecule and the heat released in the reaction. We propose that the heat released during catalysis generates an asymmetric pressure wave that results in a differential stress at the protein-solvent interface that transiently displaces the centre-of-mass of the enzyme (chemoacoustic effect). This novel perspective on how enzymes respond to the energy released during catalysis suggests a possible effect of the heat of reaction on the structural integrity and internal degrees of freedom of the enzyme.},

Previous guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl; an ionic denaturant) experiments of a designed, naturally occurring βα fold, Di-III\_14, revealed a cooperative, two-state unfolding transition and a modest stability. Continuous-flow mixing experiments in our laboratory revealed a simple two-state reaction in the microsecond to millisecond time range and consistent with the thermodynamic results. In striking contrast, the protein remains folded up to 9.25 M in urea, a neutral denaturant, and hydrogen exchange (HDX) NMR analysis in water revealed the presence of numerous high-energy states that interconvert on a time scale greater than seconds. The complex protection pattern for HDX corresponds closely with a pair of electrostatic networks on the surface and an extensive network of hydrophobic side chains in the interior of the protein. Mutational analysis showed that electrostatic and hydrophobic networks contribute to the resistance to urea denaturation for the WT protein; remarkably, single charge reversals on the protein surface restore the expected urea sensitivity. The roughness of the energy surface reflects the densely packed hydrophobic core; the removal of only two methyl groups eliminates the high-energy states and creates a smooth surface. The design of a very stable βα fold containing electrostatic and hydrophobic networks has created a complex energy surface rarely observed in natural proteins.},

In the present study, we present previously undescribed NMR methods to study the interactions of proteins with their hydration shell and the ice lattice in frozen solution. We applied these methods to compare solvent interaction of an ice-binding type III antifreeze protein (AFP III) and ubiquitin a non-ice-binding protein in frozen solution. We measured 1H-1H cross-saturation and cross-relaxation to provide evidence for a molecular contact surface between ice and AFP III at moderate freezing temperatures of -35 °C. This phenomenon is potentially unique for AFPs because ubiquitin shows no such cross relaxation or cross saturation with ice. On the other hand, we detected liquid hydration water and strong water–AFP III and water–ubiquitin cross peaks in frozen solution using relaxation filtered 2H and HETCOR spectra with additional 1H-1H mixing. These results are consistent with the idea that ubiquitin is surrounded by a hydration shell, which separates it from the bulk ice. For AFP III, the water cross peaks indicate that only a portion of its hydration shell (i.e., at the ice-binding surface) is in contact with the ice lattice. The rest of AFP III’s hydration shell behaves similarly to the hydration shell of non-ice-interacting proteins such as ubiquitin and does not freeze together with the bulk water.},

A modeling procedure is presented for analysis of the temperature dependence of the generalized order parameter that extends a previous analysis (Massi and Palmer, J Am Chem Soc 2003;125:11158–11159). As part of this procedure, the potential of mean force is characterized for the N–H bond vectors of the protein backbone. This procedure accounts for the observed temperature dependence of the generalized order parameter in a representative data set from the B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G (Seewald, Pichumani, Stowell, Tibbals, Regan, and Stone, Protein Sci 2000;9:1177–1193). The results indicate a general trend, in which the force constants associated with the potential of mean force decrease with increasing temperature.

	abstract = {The conformational heterogeneity and dynamics of protein side chains contribute to function, but investigating exactly how is hindered by experimental challenges arising from the fast timescales involved and the spatial heterogeneity of protein structures. The potential of two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy for measuring conformational heterogeneity and dynamics with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution has motivated extensive effort to develop amino acids with functional groups that have frequency-resolved absorptions to serve as probes of their protein microenvironments. We demonstrate the full advantage of the approach by selective incorporation of the probe p-cyanophenylalanine at six distinct sites in a Src homology 3 domain and the application of 2D IR spectroscopy to site-specifically characterize heterogeneity and dynamics and their contribution to cognate ligand binding. The approach revealed a wide range of microenvironments and distinct responses to ligand binding, including at the three adjacent, conserved aromatic residues that form the recognition surface of the protein. Molecular dynamics simulations performed for all the labeled proteins provide insight into the underlying heterogeneity and dynamics. Similar application of 2D IR spectroscopy and site-selective probe incorporation will allow for the characterization of heterogeneity and dynamics of other proteins, how heterogeneity and dynamics are affected by solvation and local structure, and how they might contribute to biological function.},

Time-resolved X-ray methods hold promise for addressing this challenge, but have relied on the exploitation of exotic protein photoactivity, and are therefore not generalizable. Temperature jumps, through thermal excitation of the solvent, have been utilized to study protein dynamics using spectroscopic techniques, but their implementation in X-ray scattering experiments has been limited. Here, we perform temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A, demonstrating that these experiments are able to capture functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale. We show that cyclophilin A displays rich dynamics following a temperature jump, and use the resulting time-resolved signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes. Two relaxation processes are resolved: a fast process is related to surface loop motions, and a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover.},

The density distributions of the hydration water molecules around the oxygen and nitrogen atoms were calculated from the simulation trajectories, and were compared with the empirical hydration distribution functions, which were constructed from a large number of hydration water molecules found in the crystal structures of proteins. Only simulations using the force field explicitly incorporating lone-pair electrons reproduced the directionality of hydrogen bonds that is observed in the empirical distribution functions for the deprotonated oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the sp2-hybridization. The amino acids that include such atoms are functionally important glutamate, aspartate, and histidine. Therefore, a set of force field that incorporates lone-pair electrons as off-atom charge sites would be effective for considering hydrogen bond formation by these amino acids in molecular dynamics simulation studies.},

Following photolysis, the heme was found to lose most of its excess kinetic energy within 10 ps. The kinetic energy decay was found to be a single exponential with a time constant of 5.9 ps in agreement with the experimental observations of Lim, Jackson and Anfinrud [J. Phys. Chem. 100, 12 043 (1996)]. The flow of kinetic energy was found to occur primarily through nonbonded contacts. The heme doming motion causes collisions with nearby residues and large scale collective motion in the protein. However, the strong electrostatic interaction of the isoproprionate side chains, and the solvating water appears to be the single most important “doorway” for dissipation of excess kinetic energy in the heme. Those water molecules in close contact with the heme side chains were found to “warm” in less than 1.0 ps. Direct energy transfer from the heme to the protein is found to occur by “through projectile” (ligand collisions with the distal heme pocket residue), “through bond” (heme bond to proximal histidine), and “through space” (nonbonded collisional) channels. These results provide strong evidence for a spatially directed “funneling” of kinetic energy through the heme side chains to the surrounding solvent suggested by Hochstrasser and co-workers.},

              The physics of thermal transport in polymers is important in many applications, such as in heat exchangers and electronics packaging. Even though thermal conductivity models for amorphous polymers have been reported since the 1970s, none of the published models included the chain conformation and chain stiffness effects. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the chain length effect on thermal conductivity of amorphous polyethylene (PE), and the number of repeating C

              -convection), and heat transfer through nonbonding (

              Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments have been proposed to have beneficial effects on coral photobiology. Here, we investigated the relationships between green fluorescence, coral heating and tissue optics for the massive coral
              Dipsastraea
              sp. (previously
              Favia
              sp.). We used microsensors to measure tissue scalar irradiance and temperature along with hyperspectral imaging and combined imaging of variable chlorophyll fluorescence and green fluorescence. Green fluorescence correlated positively with coral heating and scalar irradiance enhancement at the tissue surface. Coral tissue heating saturated for maximal levels of green fluorescence. The action spectrum of coral surface heating revealed that heating was highest under red (peaking at 680 nm) irradiance. Scalar irradiance enhancement in coral tissue was highest when illuminated with blue light, but up to 62\% (for the case of highest green fluorescence) of this photon enhancement was due to green fluorescence emission. We suggest that GFP-like pigments scatter the incident radiation, which enhances light absorption and heating of the coral. However, heating saturates, because intense light scattering reduces the vertical penetration depth through the tissue eventually leading to reduced light absorption at high fluorescent pigment density. We conclude that fluorescent pigments can have a central role in modulating coral light absorption and heating.},

We visualized the propagation of heat inside intracellular space by tracking the temporal variation of local temperature at a time resolution of 155 μs and a temperature resolution 0.042 °C. By comparing the fast in situ temperature dynamics with computer-simulated heat diffusion, we estimated the thermal diffusivity of live HeLa cells. The present thermal diffusivity in cells was about 1/5.3 of that of water and much smaller than the values reported for bulk tissues, which may account for observations of heterogeneous intracellular temperature distributions.},

Further, we use standard GFP transfection reagents to assess temperature intracellularly in HeLa cells expressing GFP in the mitochondria. High thermal resolution and sensitivity of around 0.26\% °C−1 and 2.5\% °C−1, were achieved for wt-GFP in solution and emGFP-Mito within the cell, respectively.

We discuss protein–water dynamics, with emphasis on water that is partially confined, and the role of protein-confined water dynamics in allosteric regulation. These properties are illustrated with two systems, a homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis (HbI) and an A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR). For HbI, water–protein interactions, long known to contribute to the thermodynamics of cooperativity, are seen to influence the dynamics of the protein not only around the protein–water interface but also into the core of each globule, where dynamic and entropic changes upon ligand binding are coupled to protein–water contact dynamics. Similarly, hydration waters trapped deep inside the core region of A2AAR enable the formation of an allosteric network made of water-mediated inter-residue contacts. Extending from the ligand binding pocket to the G-protein binding site, this allosteric network plays key roles in regulating the activity of the receptor.},

We investigate the relationship between rates of energy transfer across polar and nonpolar contacts and contact dynamics for the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, a rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptor, in an antagonist-bound inactive state and agonist-bound active state. From structures sampled during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find the active state to have, on average, a lower packing density, corresponding to generally more flexibility and greater entropy than the inactive state. Energy exchange networks (EENs) are computed for the inactive and active states from the results of the MD simulations. From the EENs, changes in the rates of energy transfer across polar and nonpolar contacts are found for contacts that remain largely intact during activation. Change in dynamics of the contact, and entropy associated with the dynamics, can be estimated from the change in rates of energy transfer across the contacts. Measurement of change in the rates of energy transfer before and after the transition between states thereby provides information about dynamic contributions to activation and allostery.},

Here, we present the theoretical basis of information transfer using a simple elastic net model and recently developed entropy transfer concept in proteins. Mutual information between two residues is a measure of communication in proteins which shows the maximum amount of information that may be transferred between two residues. However, it does not explain the actual amount of transfer nor the transfer rate of information between residues. For this, dynamic equations of the system are needed. We used the Schreiber theory of information transfer and the Gaussian network Model of proteins, together with the solution of the Langevin equation, to quantify allosteric information transfer. Results of the model are in perfect agreement with ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements. Analysis of the allosteric protein Human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase shows that a multitude of paths contribute collectively to information transfer. While the peak values of information transferred are small relative to information content of residues, considering the estimated transfer rates, which are in the order of megabits per second, sustained transfer during the activity time-span of proteins may be significant.},

            Allosteric regulation is a crucial component in biochemical pathways, where ligand binding to an allosteric site modulates the enzymatic activity at a distant functional site. There is rapid growth in interest toward rational design of allosteric drugs. PDZ domain proteins (frequently encountered in signaling protein complexes) are classic examples of allostery without significant structural changes (dynamic allostery), where ligand binding leads to modulation in distal side-chain motions. So far dynamic allostery has been attributed to purely entropic effects. In contrast, here we show that a significant internal redistribution and rewiring of electrostatic interactions provide the basis of dynamic allostery in PDZ domain protein. A dramatic population shift in the pairwise hydrogen-bonded interactions involving side chains leads to the allosteric response.
          , 
            Allosteric effect implies ligand binding at one site leading to structural and/or dynamical changes at a distant site. PDZ domains are classic examples of dynamic allostery without conformational changes, where distal side-chain dynamics is modulated on ligand binding and the origin has been attributed to entropic effects. In this work, we unearth the energetic basis of the observed dynamic allostery in a PDZ3 domain protein using molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that electrostatic interaction provides a highly sensitive yardstick to probe the allosteric modulation in contrast to the traditionally used structure-based parameters. There is a significant population shift in the hydrogen-bonded network and salt bridges involving side chains on ligand binding. The ligand creates a local energetic perturbation that propagates in the form of dominolike changes in interresidue interaction pattern. There are significant changes in the nature of specific interactions (nonpolar/polar) between interresidue contacts and accompanied side-chain reorientations that drive the major redistribution of energy. Interestingly, this internal redistribution and rewiring of side-chain interactions led to large cancellations resulting in small change in the overall enthalpy of the protein, thus making it difficult to detect experimentally. In contrast to the prevailing focus on the entropic or dynamic effects, we show that the internal redistribution and population shift in specific electrostatic interactions drive the allosteric modulation in the PDZ3 domain protein.},

Our previous study suggested that atomic contacts in proteins provide the dominant pathway for energy transfer while covalent bonds do not. In the present study, we directly examined the contributions of covalent bonds and atomic contacts to the pathway of vibrational energy flow by comparing the anti-Stokes resonance Raman spectra of two myoglobin mutants: one lacked a covalent bond between heme and the polypeptide chain, and the other retained the intact bond. The two mutants showed no significant difference in temporal changes in the anti-Stokes Raman intensities of the tryptophan bands, implying that the dominant channel of vibrational energy transfer is not through the covalent bond but rather through van der Waals atomic contacts between heme and the protein moiety. The obtained insights contribute to our general understanding of energy transfer in the condensed phase.},

In addition, they also can avoid many problems related to traditional materials such as toxic chemical residues or brittleness. With the fast development of cutting-edge flexible materials and bioelectronics processing technologies, the market for biocompatible materials with extremely high or low thermal conductivity is growing rapidly. The thermal conductivity of protein films, which is usually on the order of 0.1 W/m·K, can be rather tunable as the value for stretched protein fibers can be substantially larger, outperforming that of many synthetic polymer materials. These findings indicate that the thermal conductivity and the heat transfer direction of protein-based materials can be finely controlled by manipulating their nano-scale structures. This review will focus on the structure of different fibrous proteins, such as silks, collagen and keratin, summarizing factors that can influence the thermal conductivity of protein-based materials and the different experimental methods used to measure their heat transfer properties.},

As a simple means to describe these experimental and simulated data, Buchenberg et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7, 25 (2016)] suggested a master equation model that accounts for the energy transport from an initially excited residue to some target residue. The transfer rates of the model were obtained from two scaling rules, which account for the energy transport through the backbone and via tertiary contacts, respectively, and were parameterized using simulation data of a small α-helical protein at low temperatures. To extend the applicability of the model to general proteins at room temperature, here a new parameterization is presented, which is based on extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a number of model systems. With typical transfer times of 0.5–1 ps between adjacent residues, backbone transport represents the fastest channel of energy flow. It is well described by a diffusive-type scaling rule, which requires only an overall backbone diffusion coefficient and interatom distances as input. Contact transport, e.g., via hydrogen bonds, is considerably slower (6–30 ps) at room temperature. A new scaling rule depending on the inverse square contact distance is suggested, which is shown to successfully describe the energy transport in the allosteric protein PDZ3. Since both scaling rules require only the structure of the considered system, the model provides a simple and general means to predict energy transport in proteins. To identify the pathways of energy transport, Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations are performed, which highlight the competition between backbone and contact transport channels.},

	abstract = {From guiding chemical reactivity in synthesis or protein folding to the design of energy diodes, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution harnesses the power to influence the underlying fundamental principles of chemistry. To evaluate the ability to steer these processes, the mechanism and time scales of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution through aromatic molecular scaffolds have been assessed by utilizing twodimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. 2D IR cross peaks reveal energy relaxation through an aromatic scaffold from the azido- to the cyanovibrational reporters in para-azidobenzonitrile (PAB) and para(azidomethyl)benzonitrile (PAMB) prior to energy relaxation into the solvent. The rates of energy transfer are modulated by Fermi resonances, which are apparent by the coupling cross peaks identified within the 2D IR spectrum. Theoretical vibrational mode analysis allowed the determination of the origins of the energy flow, the transfer pathway, and a direct comparison of the associated transfer rates, which were in good agreement with the experimental results. Large variations in energy-transfer rates, approximately 1.9 ps for PAB and 23 ps for PAMB, illustrate the importance of strong anharmonic coupling, i.e., Fermi resonance, on the transfer pathways. In particular, vibrational energy rectification is altered by Fermi resonances of the cyanoand azido-modes allowing control of the propensity for energy flow.},

	abstract = {In a previous paper [M. Schade, P. Hamm, Vibrational energy transport in the presence of intrasite vibrational energy redistribution, J. Chem. Phys. 131 (2009) 044511], it has been shown that on ultrashort length and time scales, the speed of vibrational energy transport along a molecular chain is limited by intrasite vibrational relaxation rather than the actual intersite propagation. However, since intrasite vibrational relaxation is length independent, the intersite propagation rate is expected to become ratelimiting at some length scale, where propagation approaches the bulk limit. In the present paper, we investigate the transition between both regimes. The response of different types of modes may be very different at early times, depending on how much they contribute directly to energy transport. Surprisingly though, when averaging the energy content over all vibrational modes of the various chain sites, the complexity of the intrasite vibrational relaxation process is completely hidden so that energy transport on the nanoscale can be described by an effective propagation rate, that equals the bulk value, even at short times.},

Rates of energy transfer across van der Waals contacts vary inversely with the variance of the contact length, with the same constant of proportionality for all nonpolar contacts of HP36. A similar relation is observed for hydrogen bonds, but the proportionality depends on contact pairs, with hydrogen bonds stabilizing the α-helices all exhibiting the same constant of proportionality, one that is distinct from those computed for other polar contacts.

Entropy associated with dynamics of polar contacts within each globule and with contacts between the hemes and water cluster is found to increase upon ligation.

Both theory and the results of the simulations support a scaling relation between the energy transfer rate and the inverse of the variance in the distance between hydrogen-bonded contacts. The results of the MD simulations do not support such a relation for longer-range charged contacts. Instead, the energy transfer rate is found to scale as a power law in the distance between charged groups. The scaling between rates of vibrational energy transfer across nonbonded contacts interacting via short-range potentials and conformational dynamics suggests a relation between vibrational energy transfer rates and entropy associated with the dynamics of interacting residues. The use of time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy to determine change in conformational entropy with change in protein functional state is discussed, and an expression quantifying the connection is provided.},

For junctions formed by alkane chains, in which thermalization occurs only slowly, measurements reveal that thermal resistance is controlled by bonding with the substrates, whereas fluorination can introduce thermal resistance within the molecules themselves, although the mechanism remains unclear. Here we present results of quantum-mechanical calculations of elastic and inelastic scattering rates, the length over which thermalization occurs, and thermal conductance in alkane and perfluoroalkane junctions. The contribution to thermalization of quantum effects that give rise to many-body localization (MBL) in isolated molecules is examined. While MBL does not occur due to dephasing, thermalization is typically too slow to establish local temperature if the same molecule in isolation exhibits MBL. The results indicate limitations on the applicability of classical molecular simulations in modeling thermal transport in molecular junctions.},

	abstract = {The effects of ligand binding on an oxygen sensor protein, FixLH, were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. To illustrate the network of residue interactions in the deoxy, oxy, and carbomonoxy states of FixLH, we employed the energy exchange network (EEN) model in which residue interactions were evaluated in terms of local transport coefficients of energy flow. As a result, the difference map of EEN between the deoxy and oxy (deoxy and carbomonooxy) states clearly demonstrated the allosteric transition, although the structural changes by ligand binding are small. It is known that the FixLH forms a homodimer in solution, although neither O2 nor CO binding exhibits cooperativity. Therefore, we conjectured that the primary event after ligand binding occurs essentially at the monomer level, and it is subsequently followed by quaternary structural changes. The difference EEN maps showed that two regions, (A) the junction between the coiled-coil linker and the sensor domain and (B) the potential dimer interface, experienced considerable change of the energy-transport coefficients, indicating that these two regions play important roles in quaternary structural changes and signal transduction in response to ligand binding.},

Upon photoexcitation, a large amount of excess vibrational energy is selectively deposited on heme due to extremely fast internal conversion. This excess energy is redistributed to the surrounding protein moiety and then to water. Vibrational energy flow in myoglobin (Mb) was examined using picosecond time-resolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy. We used the Trp residue directly contacting the heme group as a selective probe for vibrationally excited populations. Trp residues were placed at different position close to the heme by site-directed mutagenesis. This technique allows us to monitor the excess energy on residue-to-residue basis. Anti-Stokes UVRR measurements for Mb mutants suggest that the dominant channel for energy transfer in Mb is the pathway through atomic contacts between heme and nearby amino acid residues as well as that between the protein and solvent water. It is found that energy flow through proteins is analogous to collisional exchange processes in solutions.},

Recent work has examined relations between EENs and protein dynamics as well as structure.

	abstract = {Vibrational energy flow in proteins was studied by monitoring the timeresolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman scattering of three myoglobin mutants in which a Trp residue substitutes a different amino acid residue near heme. The anti-Stokes Raman intensities of the Trp residue in the three mutants increased with similar rates after depositing excess vibrational energy at heme, despite the difference in distance between heme and each substituted Trp residue along the main chain of the protein. This indicates that vibrational energy is not transferred through the main chain of the protein but rather through atomic contacts between heme and the Trp residue. Distinct differences were observed in the amplitude of the band intensity change between the Trp residues at different positions, and the amplitude of the band intensity change exhibits a correlation with the extent of exposure of the Trp residue to solvent water. This correlation indicates that atomic contacts between an amino acid residue and solvent water play an important role in vibrational energy flow in a protein.},

The H-bond connectivity is shown to modulate energy transfer efficiency in protein helical structures. , Energy transport in proteins is critical to a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in living organisms. While strenuous efforts have been made to study vibrational energy transport in proteins, thermal transport processes across the most fundamental building blocks of proteins, i.e. helices, are not well understood. This work studies energy transport in a group of “isomer” helices. The π-helix is shown to have the highest thermal conductivity, 110\% higher than that of the α-helix and 207\% higher than that of the 3 10 -helix. The H-bond connectivity is found to govern thermal transport mechanisms including the phonon spectral energy density, dispersion, mode-specific transport, group velocity, and relaxation time. The energy transport is strongly correlated with the H-bond strength which is also modulated by the H-bond connectivity. These fundamental insights provide a novel perspective for understanding energy transfer in proteins and guiding a rational molecule-level design of novel materials with configurable H-bonds.},

We succeeded in the real-time mapping of the vibrational energy flow in a protein with the spatial resolution of a single amino acid residue by combining time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy and site-directed single-Trp mutagenesis. Anti-Stokes Raman intensities of the Trp residues at different sites exhibited different temporal evolutions, reflecting propagation of the energy released by the heme group. A classical heat transport model was not able to reproduce the entire experimental data set, showing that we need a molecular-level description to explain the energy flow in a protein.

By taking advantage of the extremely short nonradiative excited state lifetime of heme in the protein (, ps), excess vibrational energy of 20000À25000 cmÀ1 was optically deposited selectively at the heme site. Subsequent energy relaxation in the protein moiety was investigated by monitoring the anti-Stokes UVRR intensities of the Trp59 residue, which is a single tryptophan residue involved in the protein that is located close to the heme group. It was found from temporal changes of the anti-Stokes UVRR intensities that the energy flow from the heme to Trp59 and the energy release from Trp59 took place with the time constants of 1À3 and ∼8 ps, respectively. These data are consistent with the time constants for the vibrational relaxation of the heme and heating of water reported for hemeproteins. The kinetics of the energy flow were not affected by the amount of excess energy deposited at the heme group. These results demonstrate that the present technique is a powerful tool for studying the vibrational energy flow in proteins.},

Moreover, the calculations suggest that the experimentally measured cross-peak among the CN and CO modes does not correspond to direct excitation of the CO normal mode but rather reflects excited low-frequency vibrations that anharmonically couple to the CO mode. Complementary quasiclassical trajectory calculations are found to be in good overall agreement with the quantum calculations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is essential for protein function. It is responsible for efficient energy dissipation in reaction sites, and has been linked to pathways of allosteric communication. While it is understood that VET occurs via backbone as well as via non-covalent contacts, little is known about the competition of these two transport channels, which determines the VET pathways. To tackle this problem, we equipped the β-hairpin fold of a tryptophan zipper with pairs of non-canonical amino acids, one serving as a VET injector and one as a VET sensor in a femtosecond pump probe experiment. Accompanying extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations combined with a master equation analysis unravel the VET pathways. Our joint experimental/computational endeavor reveals the efficiency of backbone vs. contact transport, showing that even if cutting short backbone stretches of only 3 to 4 amino acids in a protein, hydrogen bonds are the dominant VET pathway.},

To provide a more general approach, we derive scaling rules for vibrational energy transport in a globular protein, which are identified from extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of vibrational energy flow in the villin headpiece subdomain HP36. We parametrize a master equation based on inter-residue, residue-solvent, and heater-residue energy-transfer rates, which closely reproduces the results of the all-atom simulations. From that fit, two scaling rules emerge, one for energy transport along the protein backbone which relies on a diffusion model and another for energy transport between tertiary contacts, which is based on a harmonic model. Requiring only the calculation of mean and variance of relatively few atomic distances, the approach holds the potential to predict the pathways and time scales of vibrational energy flow in large proteins.},

	abstract = {We investigate energy transport through an α-aminoisobutyric acid-based 3 10 -helix dissolved in chloroform in a combined experimental-theoretical approach. Vibrational energy is locally deposited at the N terminus of the helix by ultrafast internal conversion of a covalently attached, electronically excited, azobenzene moiety. Heat flow through the helix is detected with subpicosecond time resolution by employing vibrational probes as local thermo meters at various distances from the heat source. The experiment is supplemented by detailed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the process, revealing good qualitative agreement with experiment: Both theory and experiment exhibit an almost instantaneous temperature jump of the reporter units next to the heater which is attributed to the direct impact of the isomerizing azobenzene moiety. After this impact event, helix and azobenzene moiety appear to be thermally decoupled. The energy deposited in the helix thermalizes on a subpicosecond timescale and propagates along the helix in a diffusive-like process, accompanied by a significant loss into the solvent. However, in terms of quantitative numbers, theory and experiment differ. In particular, the MD simulation seems to overestimate the heat diffusion constant (2 Å 2 ps −1 from the experiment) by a factor of five.},

The reorganized network upon activation contains contributions from structural as well as from dynamic changes and corresponding entropic contributions to the free energy of activation, which are estimated in terms of the change in rates of energy transfer across non-covalent contacts. The role of water in the EENs and in activation of GLP-1R is also investigated. The dynamics of water in contact with the central polar network of the transmembrane region is found to be significantly slower for both activated states compared to the inactive state. This result is consistent with the contribution of water molecules to activation of GLP-1R previously suggested and resembles water dynamics in parts of the transmembrane region found in earlier studies of rhodopsin-like GPCRs.},

In this paper we present software which collects an ensemble of (network) methods tailored towards the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and/or interactions of proteins with ligands of other type, e.g. nucleic acids, oligosaccharides etc. In parallel, we propose the use of the network differential analysis as a method to identify residues mediating key interactions between proteins. We use a model system, to show that in combination with other, already published methods, also included in pyProGA, it can be used to make such predictions. Such extended repertoire of methods allows to cross-check predictions with other methods as well, as we show here. In addition, the possibility to construct PRN models from various kinds of input is so far a unique asset of our code. One can use structural data as defined in PDB files and/or from data on residue pair interaction energies, either from force-field parameters or fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations. pyProGA is a free open-source software available from https://gitlab.com/Vlado\_S/pyproga.},

Here we summarize recent advances in understanding the function of linkers and the advantages of adopting mutlidomain architecture with disorder linkers. It was shown that linkers between domains enhance the local domain concentration and make the allosteric regulation of weakly interacting partners possible, while linkers with only one tethered end cause an entropy effect to reduce binding affinity and prevent aggregation.},

	abstract = {Vibrational energy flow in the many degrees of freedom in proteins governs energy-barrier-crossing processes, such as conformational exchanges and thermal reactions. The intensity of anti-Stokes Raman bands arises from vibrationally excited populations and can thus function as a selective probe for the excess energy. Time-resolved observations of the anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) intensity of amino acid residues provide information about the flow of excess energy in proteins, with the spatial resolution of an amino acid residue. The answer to the question of whether the extent of vibrational excitation in any given vibrational modes reflects the extent of excitation in the whole molecule under nonequilibrium conditions is not straightforward. Here, we calculated the occupation probabilities of vibrational states for model compounds of amino acids under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. At a given temperature, the occupation probability of the model compound of tryptophan under nonequilibrium conditions was nearly identical to that under equilibrium conditions at high temperature. Thus, the anti-Stokes band intensities of Trp residues in the nonequilibrium condition indicate the temperature of the molecules with equivalent energy in the equilibrium condition. In addition, we showed that the temperatures calculated on the basis of two UVRR bands of tryptophan in a time-resolved spectrum agreed with each other within the experimental uncertainty. The present results demonstrate that anti-Stokes UVRR bands of Trp residues serve as an excellent spectroscopic thermometer for determining the local temperature in proteins under nonequilibrium conditions.},

	abstract = {Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of vibrational energy flow induced by the imposition of a thermal gradient have been performed on the μ2-dimeric enzyme glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase (GSAM), the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, in order to identify energy transport pathways and to elucidate their role as potential allosteric communication networks for coordinating functional dynamics, specifically the negative cooperativity observed in the motion of the two active site gating loops. Fully atomistic MD simulations of thermal diffusion were executed with a GROMACS simulation package on a fully solvated GSAM enzyme by heating various active site target ligands (initially, catalytic intermediates and cofactors) to 300K while holding the remainder of the protein and the solvent bath at 10K and monitoring the temperature T(t) of all the enzyme residues as a function of time over a 1ns observation window. Energy is observed to be deposited in a relatively small number of discrete chains of residues most of which contribute to specific structural or biochemical functionality. Thermal linkages between all thermally active chains were established by isolating a specific pair of chains and performing a thermal diffusion simulation on the pair, one held at 300K and the other at 10K, with the rest of the protein frozen in its initial atomic configuration and thus thermally unresponsive. Proceeding in this way, it was possible to map out multiple pathways of vibrational energy flow leading from one of the active sites through a network of contiguous residues, many of which were evolutionarily conserved and linked by hydrogen bonds, into the other active site and ultimately to the other gating loop.},

	abstract = {Based on Schreiber’s work on transfer entropy, a molecular theory of nonlinear information transfer between residue pairs in proteins is developed. The joint distribution function for residue fluctuations required by the theory is expressed in terms of tensor Hermite polynomials that conveniently separate harmonic and nonlinear contributions to information transfer. The harmonic part of information transfer is expressed as the difference between time dependent and independent mutual information. Third order nonlinearities are discussed in detail. The amount and speed of information transfer between residues, which are important for understanding allosteric activity in proteins, are discussed. Mutual information between two residues is commonly used for information transfer. While mutual information shows the maximum amount of information that may be transferred between two residues, it does not explain the actual amount of transfer nor the transfer rate of information. For this, dynamic equations of the system are needed. The solution of the Langevin equation and molecular dynamics trajectories are used in the present work for this purpose. Allosteric communication in human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is studied as an example. Calculations show that several paths contribute collectively to information transfer. Important residues on these paths are identified. Time resolved information transfer between these residues, their amplitudes, and transfer rates, which are in agreement with time resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements in general, are estimated. Peak values of calculated information transfer, ∼0.01–0.04 bits, are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the information content of residues. They are comparable to mutual information values, however. Estimated transfer rates are in the order of 1–20 megabits per second, and sustained transfer during the activity time-span of proteins may be significant. Information transfer from third order contributions is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the harmonic terms, showing that harmonic analysis is a good approximation to information transfer.},

Despite extensive efforts, the molecular mechanism of this process remains elusive. Using the energy flow theory, we uncovered a fundamental new phenomenon: the heme energy is redistributed by sinusoidal waves with a ubiquitous fundamental frequency and two overtones. The energy waves emanate from the heme into the myoglobin backbone via a conduit of five consecutive dihedrals of the proximal histidine and then travel quickly along the backbone to reach sidechains across the protein. This mechanism is far more effective than the diffusion-based mechanism from previous studies because waves are systematic while diffusion is random. To propagate energy waves, coordinates must cooperate, resulting in collective modes that are singular vectors of the generalized work functional. These modes show task partitioning: a handful of high-energy modes generate large-scale breathing motion, which loosens up the protein matrix to enable hundreds of low-energy vibrational modes for energy transduction.},

Activation in a protein differs from activation in a small molecule in that it involves directed and systematic energy flows through preferred channels encoded in the protein structure. Understanding the nature of these energy flow channels and how energy flows through them during activation is critical for understanding protein conformational changes. We recently [W. Li and A. Ma, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 114103 (2016)] developed a rigorous statistical mechanical framework for understanding potential energy flows. Here, we complete this theoretical framework with a rigorous theory for kinetic energy flows: potential and kinetic energies interconvert when impressed forces oppose inertial forces, whereas kinetic energy transfers directly from one coordinate to another when inertial forces oppose each other. This theory is applied to analyzing a prototypic system for biomolecular conformational dynamics: the isomerization of an alanine dipeptide. Among the two essential energy flow channels for this process, dihedral ϕ confronts the activation barrier, whereas dihedral θ1 receives energy from potential energy flows. Intriguingly, θ1 helps ϕ to cross the activation barrier by transferring to ϕ via direct kinetic energy flow all the energy it received—an increase in

	abstract = {While the theory of protein folding is well developed, including concepts such as rugged energy landscape, folding funnel, etc., the same degree of understanding has not been reached for the description of the dynamics of allosteric transitions in proteins. This is not only due to the small size of the structural change upon ligand binding to an allosteric site, but also due to challenges in designing experiments that directly observe such an allosteric transition. On the basis of recent pump-probe-type experiments (Buchli et al. 2013 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA110, 11 725–11 730. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1306323110)) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (Buchenberg et al. 2017 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA114, E6804–E6811. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1707694114)) studying an photoswitchable PDZ2 domain as model for an allosteric transition, we outline in this perspective how such a description of allosteric communication might look. That is, calculating the dynamical content of both experiment and simulation (which agree remarkably well with each other), we find that allosteric communication shares some properties with downhill folding, except that it is an ‘order–order’ transition. Discussing the multiscale and hierarchical features of the dynamics, the validity of linear response theory as well as the meaning of ‘allosteric pathways’, we conclude that non-equilibrium experiments and simulations are a promising way to study dynamical aspects of allostery.

The PDZ3 domain represents a prime example of an allosteric single-domain protein, as it features a well-established long-range coupling between the C-terminal α3-helix and ligand binding. In an intriguing experiment, Hamm and co-workers employed photoswitching of the α3-helix to initiate a conformational change of PDZ3 that propagates from the C-terminus to the bound ligand within 200 ns. Performing extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the modeling of the experiment reproduces the measured time scales and reveals a detailed picture of the allosteric communication in PDZ3. In particular, a correlation analysis identifies a network of contacts connecting the α3-helix and the core of the protein, which move in a concerted manner. Representing a one-step process and involving direct α3-ligand contacts, this cooperative transition is considered as the elementary step in the propagation of conformational change.},

Here, using extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, a time-dependent picture of the allosteric communication in PDZ2S is developed. The simulations reveal that allostery amounts to the propagation of structural and dynamical changes that are genuinely nonlinear and can occur in a nonlocal fashion.

Amino acids are divided into nine structural categories according to three secondary structure states and three solvent accessibility levels. To take account of amino acid abundance differences across protein structures, we normalize the observed density by the expected density defining a density index. Solvent accessibility levels exert the predominant influence in determinations of the regular residue density. Explicitly, the regular density values vary approximately linearly with respect to solvent accessibility levels, the linearity parameters depending on the amino acid. The charge index reveals pronounced inequalities between lysine and arginine in their interactions with acidic residues. The aromatic density calculations in all structural categories parallel the regular density calculations, indicating that the aromatic residues are distributed as a random sample of all residues. Moreover, aromatic residues are found to be over-represented in the neighborhood of all amino acids. This result might be attributed to nucleation sites and protein stability being substantially associated with aromatic residues.},
