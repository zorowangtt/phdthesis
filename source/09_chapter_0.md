# Introduction {#cha1}
Although proteins and protein-based materials,
such as meat, egg, silk and leather, have had a place for millennia in society,
seeing them as a distinct category of materials was in the 18th century
due to they are found to tend to coagulate or flocculate under high temperature or acid conditions by Antoine Fourcroy and others.
In 1958, the first X-ray crystallographic structure of myoglobin, a globular protein molecule, were published by John Kendrew, hereafter, it opened a new era in structural biology.[@brändén1999]
Increasing number of protein structures are characterized by not just X-ray crystallography also nuclear magnetic resonance and high resolution electron microscope, and stored in the protein data bank, https://www.rcsb.org.



## Energy and heat transfer in solids


## Proteins
(Introduce the protein material and their features.)


## Vibrational energy transfer in Proteins

## Methods of investigating energy transfer in proteins
### Equilibrium MD simulations 
based on linear response theory,
Direct derivation of energy transfer based on physical tuition (Yamato)
Green-Kubo relation was used to calculate the thermal conductivity (Yamato)

### Time-resolved spectroscopy techniques
Direct observation of energy flow in peptide helices by real-time FTIR absorption spectrum (experiment, Stock)
Direct observation of energy flow in heme proteins by time-resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy (Mizutani)

### Non-equilibrium molecular simulations 
on kinetic energy redistribution in heme proteins (John)
artificial heater in helices and proteins (Stock)

### Normal mode-based methods
David.

## Energy transduction mechanism
covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, non-bonded contacts
