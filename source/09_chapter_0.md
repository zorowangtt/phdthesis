# Introduction {#cha1}
Although proteins and protein-based materials,
such as meat, egg, silk and leather, have had a place for millennia in society,
seeing them as a distinct category of materials was in the 18th century
due to they are found to tend to coagulate or flocculate under high temperature or acid conditions by Antoine Fourcroy and others.
In 1958, the first X-ray crystallographic structure of myoglobin, a globular protein molecule, were published by John Kendrew, hereafter, a new era in protein structural biology was began.[@brändén1999]
Since then, protein structure determination has evolved beyond X-ray crystallography.
With the advancements in techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-resolution electron microscopy, and computational methods, an increasing number of protein structures ([@fig:proteinnumber]) are being characterized.
These efforts are driven by the goal of achieving atomic-level resolution and a deeper understanding of protein structure, property and function.

![Overall growth of protein structures released per year. Data was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org), which serves as a valuable repository for storing and sharing these protein structures.](figures/introduction/proteinnumber.jpeg){#fig:proteinnumber}

After characterizing the structure of a large number of proteins, people found that most natural proteins are linear polymers with a sequence constructed by 20 different amino acids.
The distinguishing feature among these 20 amino acids is the unique side chain attached to the central carbon atom (C) that connects the hydrogen atom, amino group (NH2), and carboxyl group (COOH).
