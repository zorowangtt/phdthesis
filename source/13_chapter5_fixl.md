# Energy transport and its function in sensory domain of *Bj*FixL{#cha5}

*Bradyrhizobium japonicum* lives symbiotically with leguminous plants in
root nodules, where they fix nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into
nitrogenous fertilizer for the plants under hypoxic conditions.
Its FixL/FixJ two-component system (TCS) is responsible for sensing diatomic
gas molecules (such as O~2~, CO, and NO) and regulates the expression of
the genes related to nitrogen fixation.[@zschiedrich2016] The FixL protein of
*Bradyrhizobium japonicum* (*Bj*FixL) is comprised of two distinct
domains: a tandem Per-Arnt-Sim (**PAS**) domain consisting of PAS-A and
PAS-B (***Bj*FixLH**); and a histidine kinase (**HK**) domain
controlling autophosphorylation and phosphotransferase. *Bj*FixLH senses
the gaseous diatomic molecules through a heme *b* cofactor, whose one
side of the axial ligand coordinated with the side chain of amino acid
HIS200 of *Bj*FixLH protein and the other axial position coordinated
with/without gas diatomic molecules.[@gilles-gonzalez1994;@gao2009;@taylor1999;@semenza2003;@chan2001;@henry2011] When the heme iron is at its
unliganded ferrous/ferric metal state, its conjugated HK domain will be
activated and undergo autophosphorylation and phosphotransferase, while
binding of strong-field ligands (O~2~, CO, NO, cyanide, imidazole, etc.)
will inactivate HK domain and impede the expression of nitrogen
fixation.[@chan2001;@rodgers2005;@gong1998]

Several hypotheses on the signaling mechanism of the PAS-B domain upon
ligand binding have been proposed: *spin-state,*[@gilles-gonzälez1995;@bertolucci1996;@honorio-felício2016] *ligand-induced
conformational changes*,[@taylor1999;@ayers2008;@rodgers1996;@shiro2002;@hiruma2007]] *redox potential of heme,*[@honorio-felício2016] and
*affinity (pKa).*[@winkler1996] For the *spin-state* *hypothesis*, it has been
reported that all the high-spin forms (*Bj*FixL, met-*Bj*FixL and
F^-^-*Bj*FixL) are active while all the low-spin forms (O~2~-*Bj*FixL,
NO-*Bj*FixL, CO-*Bj*FixL, imidazole-*Bj*FixL and CN^-^-*Bj*FixL) are
inactive.[@gilles-gonzälez1995;@tuckerman2002] However, the degree of inhibition strongly depends on
the type of ligand, i.e. not fully inhibited (CO and NO) and fully
inhibited (oxygen, imidazole and cyano),[@tuckerman2002] indicating the limitation
of the *spin-state hypothesis* for the comprehensive explanation of the
signaling mechanism. Currently, the *ligand-induced conformational
changes* mechanism is generally accepted to switch kinase activity
on/off by long-range effect of ligand binding.[@shimizu2015] Based on the crystal
structural analysis, the averaged positional differences with
met-*Bj*FixL in the FG loop are measured as 0.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.7 Å in NO,
CN^-^, imidazole, and oxygen binding forms of *Bj*FixLs,
respectively.[@gong2000] A distal ARG220 has a special selectivity on oxygen
with an orientation change breaking its hydrogen bond with heme
propionate side chain 7 to form a new one with oxygen to stabilize the
oxygen molecule.[@jasaitis2006;@dunham2003;@balland2006] ARG206 has a common positive influence on
different ligands binding during signal transduction through
interactions with the heme edge.[@gong2000;@gilles-gonzalez2006;@gong1998] ARG208, ILE209 and ILE210 of
*Rhizobium meliloti* (*Rm*FixL) corresponding to residue 214-216 of the
FG loop in *Bj*FixL, regulate the activity of the HK domain through
their interactions with O~2~.[@miyatake2000;@mukai2000] Crystallographic data analysis and
mutagenesis experiments have suggested that the rearrangement of the
hydrogen bonding and salt bridges between the heme propionates and the
FG loop upon ligands binding might be responsible for FixL allosteric
transition.

Unlike other membrane-embedded histidine kinases,[@taylor1999;@salvi2017;@shiro2002] *Bj*FixL is a
water-soluble sensor and forms a homodimer in the
cytoplasm.[@möglich2009;@miyatake2000;@möglich2009;@wright2018] The sensory domain of *Bj*FixLs forms inner and
outer surfaces after folding, where the inner surface binds to a heme
*b* cofactor and the outer surface makes contacts with the opposing
monomer and the flanking Jα helix to form a homodimer.[@bhate2015] The dimer
interface in FixLH homodimer is continuous and highly connected,
comprising of α'α, Aα, Bα helices, Gα, Hα, Iα strands and the Jα
helix.[@ayers2008] Mutation experiments[@jasaitis2006;@dunham2003;@balland2006;@gilles-gonzalez2006;@miyatake2000;@mukai2000;@yamawaki2016;@tanaka2006] pointed out that
multiple residues surrounding the heme core and on the dimer interface
may play a key role in the signal transmission event according to the
decrease of activity in the HK domain at different extents. The
functional roles of the dimer interface in other heme proteins have been
investigated for signal transduction and modulation,[@ayers2008;@diensthuber2013] facilitating
the cooperative binding of oxygens in HbI[@leitner2020]or controlling the
enzymatic activity.[@skalova2020] The importance of the potential dimer interface
was highlighted by studies of the monomeric form of *Bj*FixLHs.[@ota2019] As
pointed out by a previous study, there are no direct interactions
between the PAS-B domain and HK domain in *Bj*FixL but a coiled-coil
linker (Jα helix) connecting them and the reduction of HK domain
activity in met-*Bj*FixL by residues mutagenesis of Jα helix suggested
the Jα helix could be a potential signal transmission gate from PAS-B
domain to the HK domain.[@wright2018] However, the precise roles of the dimer
interface and the coiled-coil linker region between the PAS-B domain and
HK domain have not been detailed yet, due to the lack of structural
information at the atomic level for the *Bj*FixL dimer so far (@fig:CrystalStructure). There remain questions about the role of the dimer interface and
coiled-coil linker Jα helix in the signal transduction mechanism from
the heme-bound PAS domain to the HK domain.

![Crystal structure of met-BjFixLH dimer. The role of the dimer interface and the coiled-coil linker region in the Jα helix is unclear.](figures/fixl/CrystalStructure.jpg){#fig:CrystalStructure width=100%}

The dynamics and changes in quaternary structures also play roles in the
signaling mechanism of the PAS sensor domain[@ayers2008;@yamawaki2021] Considering the
ubiquitous thermal vibrations and conformational fluctuations in
biomolecules under physiological conditions[@mizuno2020;@yamashita2018] ceaseless energy
exchange among amino acid residues occurs through interaction between
them. It has been demonstrated the analysis of energy flow across
non-bonded native contacts in proteins provides a useful tool for
characterizing the network of residue-residue interactions.[@leitner2020;@ishikura2015;@leitner2009;@leitner2020a;@leitner2008;@reid2020;@leitner2019;@ishikura2006;@poudel2021;@reid2018;@ota2019]
To illustrate such transport property of local energy flow, we
quantified a measure of the efficiency of local energy transport,
denoted hereafter as *G*, in terms of the autocorrelation function of
energy flow. The concept of *G* was introduced as an analogy with the
diffusion constant, *D*, which is expressed in terms of the velocity
autocorrelation function. Importantly, this method can illustrate both
static and dynamic effects on biomolecular functions. In fact, recent
studies[@leitner2020;@ota2019;@ishikura2015;@leitner2020a;@leitner2008;@reid2020;@leitner2019;@ishikura2006;@reid2018;@poudel2020] have demonstrated that *G* serves as a
good measure of vibrational energy transfer rate across native contacts.
In addition, we observed a scaling relationship between the rate and the
inversed value of the variance in the distance between hydrogen-bonded
contacts, while the rate is found to scale as a power low in the
distance between charged groups.[@reid2018]

In this study, we analyzed the energy flow in the active form
(met-*Bj*FixL) and the inactive form (met-*Bj*FixL-IMD) based on the
equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the X-ray
crystallographic structure of the *Bj*FixL dimer. The pattern of energy
flow was illustrated with a network graph based on the local energy flow
coefficient, *G*, for both forms of *Bj*FixL, and the effect of ligand
binding was investigated with special attention to the dimer interface.
Before we analyze the interaction network of native contacts between
amino acid residues, we performed the calculations in three stages: (1)
MD simulations to obtain the equilibrium conformational ensemble of each
state of dimeric *Bj*FixL protein, (2) calculations of the time series
of the energy flow between native contacts in the protein, and (3) the
mobility of energy flow was quantified for each contact. We used our
original computer program, CURP (CURrent calculation for
Proteins, [https://curp.jp](https://curp.jp)),[@ishikura2012;@leitner2009;@yamato2022] for the second and third stages. Finally, our results are discussed in the context of experimental studies in the literatures.

## Effects of Ligand Binding and Dimerization

![Heatmap of G of (1) met-FixLH dimer protein and (2) met-FixLH-imd dimer protein. The unit of measure on the color bar on the right is kcal^2^/(mol^2^ fs). Residue numbers and secondary structure names are labeled on the axes. Secondary structures α-helixes (green) and α-sheets (orange) are distinguished by different colors.](figures/fixl/heatmap.jpg){#fig:heatmap width=100%}

For the energy flow
analysis of met-FixLH and met-FixLH-imd models by using the CURP
program, we considered 3485 and 4069 residue pairs, respectively, in
native contacts whose nearest interatomic distances are less than 6 Å
(@fig:heatmap). Overall, the heatmap of *G*, which appear in the lower left
(chain A) and upper right (chain B), are similar to each other. To more
quantitatively evaluate the degree of similarity between the monomers,
we conducted linear regression analysis and examined the correlation of
*G*-values for the corresponding residue pairs between chain A and B
(@fig:linear-regression). As a result, the correlation coefficients are 0.9998 (R^2^ = 0.997) and 0.9823 (R^2^ = 0.984) for met-FixLH and met-FixLH-imd,
respectively. This observation indicates that chain A and B of
met-FixLH-imd behave slightly more independently than met-FixLH, in line
with the ligand-induced asymmetry found in the other histidine sensor
kinase family.[@neiditch2006] In the previous study, we investigated the effect of ligand binding on the reside interactions of the PAS-B domain of FixL
based on the MD simulation of the monomeric unit.[@ota2019] Regarding ligand
binding to FixL, it should be noted there is no cooperativity observed
between the monomers.[@reid2020] The correlation coefficient of *G*-values
between the chain A of met-FixLH (this study) and the deoxy FixLH[@ota2019] is 0.984 (R^2^ = 0.994), which is slightly smaller than that for the
met-FixLH dimer, indicating that the interactions across the dimer
interface enhance the synchronization between the monomers, although the
essential feature of the sensory domain is determined by the monomeric
structure itself.

![Energy exchange network of (a) met-FixLH dimer protein and (b) imd-FixL dimer protein.](figures/fixl/hot-spots.jpg){#fig:hot-spots width=100%}

The network pattern of *G*, illustrated in @fig:hot-spots, shows the hotspots
where busy traffic of energy flow occurs: two heme-cores and the dimer
interface. This reflects that the heme core as the active center of the
FixLH protein has a dense network framework base for the signaling
transduction to the downstream functional domain. The same feature of
intensive energy exchange on the dimer interface reflects the stable
connection of two monomers which is consistent with its low
dimer-monomer dissociation equilibrium constant and the continuousness
feature of FixLH[@ayers2008]. Also, the strong interactions on the dimer
interface imply its potential functional contributions to signaling
transduction as a bridge between the heme core and HK domain.

## Vibrational energy transfer pathways and residue interaction network

![The strong interactions, represented by dash lines, are defined by the residue pairs with G values > G~met~ + 2σ~met~ = 6.58 × 10^–3^ [kcal^2^/(mol^2^ fs)], where G~met~ (= 2.42 × 10–4 ) and σ~met~ (= 3.17 × 10–3) [kcal^2^/(mol^2^ fs)] are the mean and the standard deviation of the G-values of all residue pairs, respectively. (A1) met-FixL dimer, (B1) met-FixLH dimer. The interactions involved with the heme and the dimer interface, shown in red, are distinguished from the other interactions, shown in blue. Panels A/B2; A/B3; and A/B4 show important amino acid residues in the regions around the heme ligand and on the dimer interface; close to the N-terminus; and close to the C-terminus, respectively. It should be noted that the connections between the imidazole ligand and residue HIS200, ARG206, ARG220 and LEU236 are not shown in Panel B1.](figures/fixl/interactions.jpg){#fig:interactions width=70%}

Important pathways with busy energy traffic are highlighted
in @fig:interactions. The strong interactions are mainly on the dimer
interface and surrounding the heme core, where the EF loop, Fα, FG loop,
Gα, and Hα form a shell to wrap the heme and its ligand around.

In addition to the dimer interface, we found busy traffic of vibrational
energy transfer in two regions: (1) residue groups in direct contact
with heme, and (2) those having no direct contact with heme. **Region
(1)**, highlighted with stick model, of met-FixLH and met-FixLH-imd is
consisted of MET192 (EF loop), HIS200(Fα), TYR203(Fα), ARG206(Fα),
HIS214(FG loop), ARG220(Gα), VAL-222(Gα), and ILE238(Hα), shown in
@fig:interactions A(2) and ASP196(Fα), ARG199(Fα), HIS200(Fα), TYR203(Fα),
ARG206(Fα), ASP212(FG loop), ARG220(Gα), LEU236(Hα), shown in @fig:interactions B(2), respectively. Residues HIS200, TYR203, and ARG206 of Fα helix are
found to have strong interactions with heme both in met-FixLH and
met-FixLH-imd. The strong interaction between HIS200 and heme is due to
the Fe-N coordination bonding. The proximal ARG206 was regarded as an
important residue strongly influencing affinity and regulation through
interaction with HIS214 of the FG loop in the *Bj*FixL active state of
the heme propionate 6 in its inactive state.[@gong2000;@dunham2003;@gilles-gonzalez2006;@tanaka2006;@2008]
Few studies investigated the role of TYR203 in the signaling process, but its
potential role was mentioned in the structural analysis due to the
relative close position with heme same like ARG206.[@perutz1999] HIS214 in
met-FixLH and ASP212 in met-FixLH-imd of FG loop are found to have
strong contacts with heme. HIS214 forms a hydrogen bond with heme-
propionate 7,[@balland2006] together with ARG206 to form a stable triangular
interaction in met-FixLH. ASP212 forms a salt bridge with ARG206,[@dunham2003]
together with heme to form another stable triangular interaction in
met-FixLH-imd. A distal ARG220 was found to have strong interaction with
heme (and imidazole) both in met-FixLH and met-FixLH-imd. In ferrous
*Bj*FixLH protein, the guanidinium group of ARG220 has a special
selectivity on oxygen with an orientation change breaking its hydrogen
with heme propionate 7 to form a new one with oxygen to stabilize the
oxygen molecule.[@shimizu2015;@balland2006;@tanaka2006;@2008;@key2005;@buhrke2020]

**Region (2)** of residues having no direct contact with heme is also
recognized. TYR207 and GLU240 form a hydrogen bonding in the crystal
structure and its strength varies between oxy and deoxy forms of
*Sm*FixL.[@yano2013]
A stable triangle is formed among ARG-208(Fα), HIS162(Bα),
and GLU-246(Iα). It is noteworthy that a vibrational energy transfer
pathway in met-FixLH ( @fig:interactions A) is spanned all the way from Gα (VAL222)
to the junction between the PAS core and the Jα helix via Hα (MET234,
HIS235), Iα (VAL253, ARG254), and the highly conserved DxT motif,[@möglich2009a]
(ASP-LEU-THR). It has been suggested that the hydrophobic residue,
ILE215, VAL222, MET234, LEU236, ILE238, and VAL253 form a signal
transduction pathway from heme to the Jα helix. In fact, these
hydrophobic residues have been found not only in *Bj*FixL but also in
the equivalent sites of the other PAS domains.[@perutz1999;@bashford1987] In contrast, we
cannot recognize such a pathway for met-FixLH-imd (@fig:interactions B). Although
the structural change between met-FixLH and met-FixLH-imd is not so
large, the vibrational energy transfer pathways are markedly different
between them. Only heme-ARG220 interaction is common between met-FixLH
and met-FixLH-imd. The heme-protein interactions are almost completely
localized in the Fα helix and the FG loop.

Strong interactions across the dimer interface are mainly found in two
regions: (3) N terminus and (4) C terminus.

![Molecular dynamic simulations of met-BjFixLH without force restraints on N-terminal of A’α helix. (A) The crystal structure model of MD simulations. (B) The time evolution of distance between carbon atom of residue ILE128s.](figures/fixl/force-restraint.jpg){#fig:force-restraint width=100%}

**Region (3),** highlighted with stick models (@fig:interactions A(3) and B(3)),
includes charged residue pairs with ARG139, ARG141, and ARG146, for
met-FixLH and met-FixLH-imd, respectively. It should be noted that this
region is close to neither PAS core nor heme. To save computational
time, we imposed harmonic restraints on each Cα atom of ILE128 of chains
A and B, and neglected PAS-A domains in the calculations. Without such
restraints, the pair of A'α helices undergo considerable fluctuations
(@fig:force-restraint). Although the role of the *Bj*FixL PAS-A domain remains
unclear,[@wright2018] a possible role, speculated from the study of *Sm*FixL,[@yamawaki2021]
may be stabilization of the dimer interface of *Bj*FixL.

In **Region (4),** located in the coiled-coil linker, we recognize four
residue-residue interactions among (2 × 2 =) 4 charged residues, ASP154
and ARG254 of chain A and B (@fig:interactions A(4) and B(4)). On the downstream
of this region, we also recognized a densely connected intra-monomer
network of vibrational energy transfer pathways with ASP255, THR257,
GLU258, GLN261, THR262, ARG265 GLN267 and GLU268 (Table S2), in line
with the site-directed mutagenesis on the coiled-coil linker that
exhibited marked decrease of the kinase activity of *Bj*FixL.[@wright2018]

## Reorganization of vibrational energy transfer pathways upon ligand binding

![Reorganization of the network of vibrational energy transfer pathways. Strengthened (Weakened) paths upon ligand binding with rΔG > (<) 0.5 are indicated by dotted lines in red (blue). The residue name and residue number colored in purple and black represent the residues from chain A and chain B, respectively.](figures/fixl/difference.jpg){#fig:difference width=100%}

Superposition of the x-ray crystallographic structures of met-FixLH and
met-FixLH-imd (@fig:difference B) shows a movement of the FG loop, with an
average positional displacement of 1.4 Å,[@gong2000] together with a slight
movement of the Gα strand and the reorientation of heme propionate 6 and
7 side chains. We speculate that this structural change induced the
reorganization of the vibrational energy transfer network between heme
and the FG loop or Gα strand, leading to the modulation of signal
transmission to the downstream of PAS-B domain. To evaluate the effect
of ligand binding quantitatively, we calculated the difference (Δ*G*)
and the relative difference (rΔ*G*) of the *G*-values for residue pairs
in native contact between met-FixLH (*G*~met~) and met-FixLH-imd
(*G*~imd~), where Δ*G* = *G*~imd~ -- *G*~met~ and rΔ*G* = Δ*G* /
*G*~met~. In @fig:difference A, we illustrated the reorganization of the network
of vibrational energy transfer pathways (see also Table S4), where those
with increased *G*, shown in red, are distinguished from those with
decreased *G*, shown in blue. Ligand binding to the heme weakened
(enhanced) the interaction between heme with HIS214 (HIS200, TYR203,
ARG206, and ARG220). The intrahelical interactions within Fα were
decreased, while those between the Fα helix and the nearby secondary
structural units, such as ARG208-GLU246, ARG206-ASP212, TYR207-GLU240,
ASN189-HIS200, and ARG197-LYS225, were increased. Across the dimer
interface, we recognized that the ligand binding induced considerable
weakening of the monomer-monomer interactions involving charged residues
ASP154, GLU135/142, ARG139/141/146/174 (ARG254) in the N(C)-terminus of
the PAS-B domain. In addition, two residue pairs on the dimer interface,
ASP154-ARG254 and THR262-ARG265, exhibit increased *G*-values by ligand
binding, where the latter of which belongs to the coiled-coil linker. In
summary, ligand binding enhanced the interactions between Fα and heme or
the terminal regions of G/H/I α strands, while it weakened those within
the Fα helix, α sheet, and those across the dimer interface. These
observations suggest that the signal transmission from the heme core to
the coiled-coil linker may be mainly blocked at the bridge of G/H/I
α-strands, together with the synergetic reorganization of the compact
networks constructed by multiple highly conserved amino acid residues.
