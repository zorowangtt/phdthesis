## Thermal conductivity and energy conductivity

In previous studies, we explored the energy transport network in proteins by analyzing the _inter-residue energy conductivity_ ($G_{\alpha, \beta}$).[@ishikura2006;@leitner2010;@ishikura2015;@ota2019;@poudel2020]
As a carrier of energy for heat, we are wondering whether there are any correlations between heat and energy transfer among different partial sites, i.e., different residues. Relating the inter-residue thermal conductivity and energy conductivity will be helpful to understand the property of heat and energy transfer in proteins.

From [@eq:eqd1;@eq:eqd4;@eq:eqd5;@eq:eqd7], we can see that the difference between thermal conductivity $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ and energy conductivity ($G_{\alpha, \beta}$) is that for the latter its energy flow term ($\bm J_{ij}$) lacks of position vector, ($\bm r_i- \bm r_j$), which represents the distance information of the residues while MD simulations.
To investigate this issue, we plotted the scatter dots $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ and $G_{\alpha, \beta}$ in [@fig:lambda_energy] and performed the linear regression analysis.
Interestingly, the Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant relationship statistically between $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ and $G_{\alpha, \beta}$, with $r = 0.97, \, p << 0.05 \,(4.47 \times 10^{-168})$.
To get an estimated linear regression model that can expresses their relationship, a fitted model is given here: $\log{\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}} = 0.73 \times \log{{G}_{\alpha, \beta}} - 0.30$ with $R^2 = 0.94$.
The high similarity between $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ and $G_{\alpha, \beta}$ indicates that the

The black and red lines represent the thermal conductivity of bulk water and HP36, respectively, for comparison. The $\lambda$ values of residue-wise and contacts between peptide bonded residue pairs are adopted from our previous study.[@wang2023]](figures/non-bonded/histogram-lambda-after.png){#fig:histogram_lambda}

[@fig:histogram_lambda] shows a histogram plot of the calculated $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ through nonbonded contacts, residue-wise $\lambda$ and $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values of contacts between peptide-bonded residues.
The x-axis represents the values of $\lambda$, while the y-axis shows the frequency of occurrence of each value.
The histogram reveals that the hydrogen bond contacts have the greatest values of $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ among all nonbonded contacts, with a peak at around $2.5 \times 10^{-2}$ W m^-1^ K^-1^.
This is followed by electrostatic contacts with $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values ranging from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$ W m^-1^ K^-1^. However, their distribution appears to be broader and less sharply peaked compared to hydrogen bond contacts.
In the hydrophobic core of HP36, there are three $\pi$ stacking contacts: Phe7-Phe11 ($\lambda_{7,11}=4.9 \times 10^{-3}$), Phe7-Phe18 ($\lambda_{7,11}= 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$), and Phe11-Phe18 ($\lambda_{11,18}= 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$), with $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values that comparable with hydrogen bond contacts. 
Hydrophobic contacts, which have the most number of pairs and broad distributions ranging from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-2}$ W m^-1^ K^-1^, have much lower $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values, with peaks at around $5.9 \times 10^{-4}$ W m^-1^ K^-1^.
Overall, the histogram demonstrates that different types of nonbonded contacts have significantly different contributions to thermal transport in the protein, with hydrogen bonds playing the most important role in this HP36 protein.

## Peptide bonds? or nonbonded contacts?

![The $\lambda$ values of contacts between peptide bonded residue pairs.](figures/non-bonded/line-intra-inter-lambda.png){#fig:inter_lambda width=70%}

In light of the ongoing debate on thermal energy transport through peptide bonds and contacts [@deniz2021;@mizutani2022;@buchenberg2016], we also plotted and compared the residue-wise $\lambda$ and $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values of peptide-bonded contacts in [@fig:histogram_lambda].
The residue-wise $\lambda$ values are ranging from about 0.08 to 0.3 W m^-1^ K^-1^, while $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values of peptide-bonded contacts are ranging from about 0.01 to 0.08 W m^-1^ K^-1^.
Our results showed that both residue-wise $\lambda$ and the majority of $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values of peptide-bonded contacts were larger than those of nonbonded contacts.
However, we observed three exceptions $\lambda_{3, 6}=2.4 \times 10^{-2}$, $\lambda_{4, 15}=1.3 \times 10^{-2}$, and $\lambda_{5, 8}=2.1 \times 10^{-2}$, where their $\lambda$ values exceed $10^{-2}$ W m^-1^ K^-1^ that the thermal transport through those contacts is able to compete with that along the peptide chain.
The relatively faster thermal transport through contacts of Ser3-Asp6 and Asp4-Arg15 have also been identified with a relatively higher local energy diffusivity in studies by non-equilibrium MD simulations and master equation model.[@buchenberg2016]
These contacts are referred to as "shortcuts", as they provide an efficient energy transport pathway despite being distant along the protein sequence.
This suggests that peptide bonds play a significant role in thermal transport within proteins in HP36, highlighting the importance of considering both peptide bonds and nonbonded contacts in studies of thermal transport in proteins.

## Thermal energy transport through hydrogen bonds {#sec:role-of-hb}

![$\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ values of contacts forming hydrogen bonds and their hydrogen bond occurrence probability (_P_~HB~) during MD simulations. (a): all contacts forming hydrogen bonds; (b) contacts between residue $\alpha$ and $\alpha+4$.](figures/non-bonded/hb-capacity-lambda-all-ii4.png){#fig:hb_all_ii4}

As can be seen in [@fig:histogram_lambda], the $\lambda_{\alpha, \beta}$ values of contacts through hydrogen bonds are generally greater than that of other nonbonded contacts.
The hydrogen bonds are also found to facilitate the energy transport in proteins.[@mino2014;@deniz2021]
A scatter plot between the values of $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ and their hydrogen bond occurrence probability during the MD simulations was shown in [@fig:hb_all_ii4]a.
The linear regression analysis revealed a Pearson correlation coefficient of $r$ = 0.51 (> 0.3) and a $**p$-value of 0.007 ($\ll$ 0.05), indicating a significant correlation between $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ and hydrogen bond occurrence probability of residue pairs.

In proteins constructed in an $\alpha$-helical manner, two types of hydrogen bonds can be distinguished.
The first type, known as central hydrogen bonds, plays a key role in stabilizing the helical structure by forming hydrogen bonds between the amino group (N-H) of one amino acid and the carbonyl oxygen (O) of a second amino acid, usually occurring between residues $\alpha$ to $\alpha$+4 in the helical regions.
The second type of hydrogen bonds is formed by the sidechains of the involved amino acids, either between sidechain and sidechain or between sidechain and mainchain.
Mi√±o et al. showed that the heat diffusion along $\alpha$-helices containing both types of hydrogen bonds is twice faster than those containing only the first type of hydrogen bonds, highlighting the important role of the second type of hydrogen bonds in proteins.[@mino2014]
To investigate the role of the first type of hydrogen bond in heat transport in HP36, we classified and plotted the $\lambda$ values of 32 residue pairs between residue i and i+4 (n=1, 2, ..., 32), as shown in [@fig:hb_all_ii4]b.
In HP36, the crystal structure (PDB: 1VII) reveals the presence of three alpha-helices, H1 (residues 4-8), H2 (residues 15-18), and H3 (residues 23-32), which should give rise to eight residue pairs that form the first type of hydrogen bonds.
However, there were some residue pairs that did not form the first type of hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure but were observed to form such bonds in MD simulations.
These pairs were classified as non-helical residue pairs but formed hydrogen bonds.

However, there were some residue pairs that did not form the first type of hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure but were observed to form such bonds in MD simulations.
These pairs were classified as non-helical residue pairs but formed hydrogen bonds.
Interestingly, the $\lambda$ of non-helical residue pairs that did not have the opportunity to form hydrogen bonds was significantly lower than that of helical residue pairs.

For a detailed analysis of the role of hydrogen bonds, we focus on the contacts of residue $\alpha$ and $\alpha$+4.

However, we observed some residue pairs that did not form the first type of hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure but were observed to form such bonds in MD simulations, and they were listed in  @tbl:c_hb.
After the statistical analysis of the hydrogen bonds formation from MD trajectories, it was found that almost all hydrogen bonds of contacts between residue $\alpha$ and $\alpha$+4 were the first type, with one exception of the contact between 16SER and 20ASN, where they also formed hydrogen bonds between mainchain and sidechain.

: Hydrogen bond formation capacity _P_~HB~ between residue $\alpha$ and $\alpha+4$. MC means mainchain and SC means sidechain. {#tbl:c_hb}

Their $\lambda_{\alpha,\alpha+4}$ values, interaction types, their _P_~HB~ and contacts distances are listed in @tbl:c_hb_ii4.
The $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ values for contacts with no hydrogen bonds are significantly lower, i.e. an order of magnitude lower, than those with hydrogen bonds.
Two special residues pairs (2LEU-6ASP and 21LEU-25LYS) did not form hydrogen bonds but had relatively higher $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ values.
This may be because their interactions are stronger than those contacts with no hydrogen bonds, which are all hydrophobic residues with weak Van der Waals interactions.

A smaller data set consisting of $\lambda_{\alpha,\alpha+4}$ and _P_~HB~ with hydrogen bonds formed was used to fit a linear regression relationship, as shown in [@fig:hb_all_ii4]b.
The Pearson correlation coefficient and $p$-value are 0.80 (> 0.3) and 0.001 ($\ll$ 0.05), respectively, indicating a stronger correlation relationship than for all hydrogen bond contacts.
The contact distance is a factor that can affect thermal transport through contacts.[@reid2018] For the data set used in [@fig:hb_all_ii4]a, their distance varied at a relatively broad range (2 - 4 √Ö) compared to the smaller data set used in [@fig:hb_all_ii4]b, where the distances of all contacts were 2.1 $\pm$ 0.2 √Ö (@fig:histogram-contacts-all).

To get a better understanding of the contributions of these features to the thermal transport properties of contacts in protein,
we applied the random forest regression model to predict the log$\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ values with seven features as predictors.
The comparison of calculated and predicted log$\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ together with the feature importances are shown in @fig:random-forest-S (dataset S) and @fig:random-forest-L (dataset L).
The model of _dataset L_ resulted in $r^2$ values of 0.95 and 0.89 for training set and testing set, and the corresponding RMSE were 0.24 and 0.4, respectively.
Only the contact distance exhibited the considering contributions to the log$\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ among all the feature variables.
The model of _dataset S_ resulted in $r^2$ values of 0.89 and 0.75 for traning set and testing set, and the corresponding RMSE were 0.10 and 0.18, respectively.
The top three most important features decreased in an order of $1/ \langle d_c^2 \rangle$ >$1/ \langle \delta d_{c}^2 \rangle$ > $P_{HB}$.
After the dataset gets smaller, we can see that the prediction performance (R^2^) slightly decreased for training datasets, but has a bigger decrease in prediction performance on testing set.
The difference in feature importances between the two datasets indicates that the contact distance plays a dominant role in determining the value of log$\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ for a wide range of contacts.
On the other hand, for short-distance contacts ($\langle d_c\rangle$ < 4 √Ö), both the average squared deviation ($\langle \delta d_c^2 \rangle$) and the hydrogen bonding probability ($P_{HB}$) become increasingly important.
This observation aligns with the notion that the energy transport of hydrogen bonding contact is inversely proportional to the variance of the contact.
The motion of these contacts can be modeled as a harmonic oscillator.[@buchenberg2016]
Due to the limited numbers of data points, a further smaller dataset ($\langle d_c\rangle$ < 2.8 √Ö) resulted in a model with very poor prediction performance.
If we take a look at the heat current expression in @eq:eqc1, we can find that two terms, i.e. (${\bm{r}_i}-{\bm{r}_j}$) and $\bm{F}_{ij}$, are closely associated with the contact distance.
While as the contact distance decreases, there is an increase in the proportion of hydrogen bonding contacts.
Consequently, the importance of both $\langle \delta d_c^2 \rangle$ and ($P_{HB}$ becomes more pronounced.
Moreover, a pairwise correlation analysis of all features and $\lambda_{\alpha,\beta}$ values was performed and their Pearson correlation coefficients were shown in @fig:rf-correlation-heatmap.
We found that the correlation coefficient ($r$) values between $1/ \langle d_c^2 \rangle$, $P_{HB}$, and $1/ \langle \delta d_{c}^2 \rangle$ were all greater than 0.3 and the corresponding $**p$ values are all below 0.01, indicating a statistically significant relationship between each other.

Although this study has examined the significance of feature variables that capture the static and dynamic properties of proteins in thermal transport through nonbonded contacts, it is important to note that the analysis was conducted on a limited number of pairs.
Therefore, a more comprehensive model is required to ensure its validity and applicability to a broader range of nonbonded contacts in other proteins.
