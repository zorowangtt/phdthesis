  abstract = {In physics and physical chemistry, time-resolved spectroscopy is the study of dynamic processes in materials or chemical compounds by means of spectroscopic techniques. Most often, processes are studied after the illumination of a material occurs, but in principle, the technique can be applied to any process that leads to a change in properties of a material. With the help of pulsed lasers, it is possible to study processes that occur on time scales as short as 10−16 seconds. All time-resolved spectra are suitable to be analyzed using the two-dimensional correlation method for a correlation map between the peaks.},

  abstract = {While allostery is of paramount importance for protein signaling and regulation, the underlying dynamical process of allosteric communication is not well understood. The PDZ3 domain represents a prime example of an allosteric single-domain protein, as it features a well-established long-range coupling between the C-terminal α3-helix and ligand binding. In an intriguing experiment, Hamm and co-workers employed photoswitching of the α3-helix to initiate a conformational change of PDZ3 that propagates from the C-terminus to the bound ligand within 200 ns. Performing extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the modeling of the experiment reproduces the measured time scales and reveals a detailed picture of the allosteric communication in PDZ3. In particular, a correlation analysis identifies a network of contacts connecting the α3-helix and the core of the protein, which move in a concerted manner. Representing a one-step process and involving direct α3-ligand contacts, this cooperative transition is considered as the elementary step in the propagation of conformational change.},

  abstract = {A hierarchy of residue density assessments and packing properties in protein structures are contrasted, including a regular density, a variety of charge densities, a hydrophobic density, a polar density, and an aromatic density. These densities are investigated by alternative distance measures and also at the interface of multiunit structures. Amino acids are divided into nine structural categories according to three secondary structure states and three solvent accessibility levels. To take account of amino acid abundance differences across protein structures, we normalize the observed density by the expected density defining a density index. Solvent accessibility levels exert the predominant influence in determinations of the regular residue density. Explicitly, the regular density values vary approximately linearly with respect to solvent accessibility levels, the linearity parameters depending on the amino acid. The charge index reveals pronounced inequalities between lysine and arginine in their interactions with acidic residues. The aromatic density calculations in all structural categories parallel the regular density calculations, indicating that the aromatic residues are distributed as a random sample of all residues. Moreover, aromatic residues are found to be over-represented in the neighborhood of all amino acids. This result might be attributed to nucleation sites and protein stability being substantially associated with aromatic residues.},

  abstract = {We investigate energy transport through an α-aminoisobutyric acid-based 3 10 -helix dissolved in chloroform in a combined experimental-theoretical approach. Vibrational energy is locally deposited at the N terminus of the helix by ultrafast internal conversion of a covalently attached, electronically excited, azobenzene moiety. Heat flow through the helix is detected with subpicosecond time resolution by employing vibrational probes as local thermo meters at various distances from the heat source. The experiment is supplemented by detailed nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the process, revealing good qualitative agreement with experiment: Both theory and experiment exhibit an almost instantaneous temperature jump of the reporter units next to the heater which is attributed to the direct impact of the isomerizing azobenzene moiety. After this impact event, helix and azobenzene moiety appear to be thermally decoupled. The energy deposited in the helix thermalizes on a subpicosecond timescale and propagates along the helix in a diffusive-like process, accompanied by a significant loss into the solvent. However, in terms of quantitative numbers, theory and experiment differ. In particular, the MD simulation seems to overestimate the heat diffusion constant (2 Å 2 ps −1 from the experiment) by a factor of five.},

To provide a more general approach, we derive scaling rules for vibrational energy transport in a globular protein, which are identified from extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of vibrational energy flow in the villin headpiece subdomain HP36. We parametrize a master equation based on inter-residue, residue-solvent, and heater-residue energy-transfer rates, which closely reproduces the results of the all-atom simulations. From that fit, two scaling rules emerge, one for energy transport along the protein backbone which relies on a diffusion model and another for energy transport between tertiary contacts, which is based on a harmonic model. Requiring only the calculation of mean and variance of relatively few atomic distances, the approach holds the potential to predict the pathways and time scales of vibrational energy flow in large proteins.},

  abstract = {Allostery represents a fundamental mechanism of biological regulation that is mediated via long-range communication between distant protein sites. Although little is known about the underlying dynamical process, recent time-resolved infrared spectroscopy experiments on a photoswitchable PDZ domain (PDZ2S) have indicated that the allosteric transition occurs on multiple timescales. Here, using extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, a time-dependent picture of the allosteric communication in PDZ2S is developed. The simulations reveal that allostery amounts to the propagation of structural and dynamical changes that are genuinely nonlinear and can occur in a nonlocal fashion. A dynamic network model is constructed that illustrates the hierarchy and exceeding structural heterogeneity of the process. In compelling agreement with experiment, three physically distinct phases of the time evolution are identified, describing elastic response ( ≲0.1 ≲0.1  ns), inelastic reorganization ( ∼100 ∼100  ns), and structural relaxation ( ≳1μ ≳1μ s). Issues such as the similarity to downhill folding as well as the interpretation of allosteric pathways are discussed.},

We focus on protein dynamics in the THz regime (0.1–3 THz) as opposed to lower frequencies. By characterizing the dynamic modulation of the protein backbone induced by ligand binding in terms of single residue and pairwise distance fluctuations, we identify a response nucleus modulated by the ligand that is visible only at THz frequencies. The residues of this nucleus undergo a significant stiffening and an increase in mutual coordination upon binding. Additionally, we find that the dynamic modulation is significantly more intense for the side chains, where it is also redistributed to distal regions not immediately in contact with the ligand allowing us to better define the response nucleus at THz frequencies. The overlap between the known allosterically responding residues of the investigated PDZ domains and the modulated region highlighted here suggests that fast THz dynamics could play a role in allosteric mechanisms.},

It is responsible for efficient energy dissipation in reaction sites, and has been linked to pathways of allosteric communication. While it is understood that VET occurs via backbone as well as via non-covalent contacts, little is known about the competition of these two transport channels, which determines the VET pathways. To tackle this problem, we equipped the β-hairpin fold of a tryptophan zipper with pairs of non-canonical amino acids, one serving as a VET injector and one as a VET sensor in a femtosecond pump probe experiment. Accompanying extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations combined with a master equation analysis unravel the VET pathways. Our joint experimental/computational endeavor reveals the efficiency of backbone vs. contact transport, showing that even if cutting short backbone stretches of only 3 to 4 amino acids in a protein, hydrogen bonds are the dominant VET pathway.},

In this work, we further investigated the allosteric properties of β2-AR, using Protein Contact Networks (PCNs). In this paper, we report an extensive statistical analysis of the topological and structural properties of β2-AR along its molecular dynamics trajectory to identify the activation pattern of this molecular system. The results show a distinct character to the activation that both helps to understand the allosteric switching previously identified and confirms the relevance of the network formalism to uncover relevant functional features of protein molecules.},

  abstract = {Vibrational energy flow in ferric cytochrome c has been examined by picosecond time-resolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) measurements. By taking advantage of the extremely short nonradiative excited state lifetime of heme in the protein (, ps), excess vibrational energy of 20000À25000 cmÀ1 was optically deposited selectively at the heme site. Subsequent energy relaxation in the protein moiety was investigated by monitoring the anti-Stokes UVRR intensities of the Trp59 residue, which is a single tryptophan residue involved in the protein that is located close to the heme group. It was found from temporal changes of the anti-Stokes UVRR intensities that the energy flow from the heme to Trp59 and the energy release from Trp59 took place with the time constants of 1À3 and ∼8 ps, respectively. These data are consistent with the time constants for the vibrational relaxation of the heme and heating of water reported for hemeproteins. The kinetics of the energy flow were not affected by the amount of excess energy deposited at the heme group. These results demonstrate that the present technique is a powerful tool for studying the vibrational energy flow in proteins.},

We succeeded in the real-time mapping of the vibrational energy flow in a protein with the spatial resolution of a single amino acid residue by combining time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy and site-directed single-Trp mutagenesis. Anti-Stokes Raman intensities of the Trp residues at different sites exhibited different temporal evolutions, reflecting propagation of the energy released by the heme group. A classical heat transport model was not able to reproduce the entire experimental data set, showing that we need a molecular-level description to explain the energy flow in a protein.

Taking into account 36 vibrational modes and cubic and quartic anharmonic couplings between up to three different modes, the tier model calculations are shown to qualitatively reproduce the main findings of the experiments of Rubtsov and coworkers (2011), including the energy relaxation of the initially excited CN mode and the structuredependent vibrational transport. Moreover, the calculations suggest that the experimentally measured cross-peak among the CN and CO modes does not correspond to direct excitation of the CO normal mode but rather reflects excited low-frequency vibrations that anharmonically couple to the CO mode. Complementary quasiclassical trajectory calculations are found to be in good overall agreement with the quantum calculations.},

Here, we present the theoretical basis of information transfer using a simple elastic net model and recently developed entropy transfer concept in proteins. Mutual information between two residues is a measure of communication in proteins which shows the maximum amount of information that may be transferred between two residues. However, it does not explain the actual amount of transfer nor the transfer rate of information between residues. For this, dynamic equations of the system are needed. We used the Schreiber theory of information transfer and the Gaussian network Model of proteins, together with the solution of the Langevin equation, to quantify allosteric information transfer. Results of the model are in perfect agreement with ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements. Analysis of the allosteric protein Human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase shows that a multitude of paths contribute collectively to information transfer. While the peak values of information transferred are small relative to information content of residues, considering the estimated transfer rates, which are in the order of megabits per second, sustained transfer during the activity time-span of proteins may be significant.},

  abstract = {Based on Schreiber’s work on transfer entropy, a molecular theory of nonlinear information transfer between residue pairs in proteins is developed. The joint distribution function for residue fluctuations required by the theory is expressed in terms of tensor Hermite polynomials that conveniently separate harmonic and nonlinear contributions to information transfer. The harmonic part of information transfer is expressed as the difference between time dependent and independent mutual information. Third order nonlinearities are discussed in detail. The amount and speed of information transfer between residues, which are important for understanding allosteric activity in proteins, are discussed. Mutual information between two residues is commonly used for information transfer. While mutual information shows the maximum amount of information that may be transferred between two residues, it does not explain the actual amount of transfer nor the transfer rate of information. For this, dynamic equations of the system are needed. The solution of the Langevin equation and molecular dynamics trajectories are used in the present work for this purpose. Allosteric communication in human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is studied as an example. Calculations show that several paths contribute collectively to information transfer. Important residues on these paths are identified. Time resolved information transfer between these residues, their amplitudes, and transfer rates, which are in agreement with time resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements in general, are estimated. Peak values of calculated information transfer, ∼0.01–0.04 bits, are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the information content of residues. They are comparable to mutual information values, however. Estimated transfer rates are in the order of 1–20 megabits per second, and sustained transfer during the activity time-span of proteins may be significant. Information transfer from third order contributions is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the harmonic terms, showing that harmonic analysis is a good approximation to information transfer.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of vibrational energy flow induced by the imposition of a thermal gradient have been performed on the μ2-dimeric enzyme glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminomutase (GSAM), the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, in order to identify energy transport pathways and to elucidate their role as potential allosteric communication networks for coordinating functional dynamics, specifically the negative cooperativity observed in the motion of the two active site gating loops. Fully atomistic MD simulations of thermal diffusion were executed with a GROMACS simulation package on a fully solvated GSAM enzyme by heating various active site target ligands (initially, catalytic intermediates and cofactors) to 300K while holding the remainder of the protein and the solvent bath at 10K and monitoring the temperature T(t) of all the enzyme residues as a function of time over a 1ns observation window. Energy is observed to be deposited in a relatively small number of discrete chains of residues most of which contribute to specific structural or biochemical functionality. Thermal linkages between all thermally active chains were established by isolating a specific pair of chains and performing a thermal diffusion simulation on the pair, one held at 300K and the other at 10K, with the rest of the protein frozen in its initial atomic configuration and thus thermally unresponsive. Proceeding in this way, it was possible to map out multiple pathways of vibrational energy flow leading from one of the active sites through a network of contiguous residues, many of which were evolutionarily conserved and linked by hydrogen bonds, into the other active site and ultimately to the other gating loop.},

The H-bond connectivity is shown to modulate energy transfer efficiency in protein helical structures. , Energy transport in proteins is critical to a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in living organisms. While strenuous efforts have been made to study vibrational energy transport in proteins, thermal transport processes across the most fundamental building blocks of proteins, i.e. helices, are not well understood. This work studies energy transport in a group of “isomer” helices. The π-helix is shown to have the highest thermal conductivity, 110\% higher than that of the α-helix and 207\% higher than that of the 3 10 -helix. The H-bond connectivity is found to govern thermal transport mechanisms including the phonon spectral energy density, dispersion, mode-specific transport, group velocity, and relaxation time. The energy transport is strongly correlated with the H-bond strength which is also modulated by the H-bond connectivity. These fundamental insights provide a novel perspective for understanding energy transfer in proteins and guiding a rational molecule-level design of novel materials with configurable H-bonds.},

Another well-studied G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) containing 7 transmembrane (TM) helices is the B2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR), for which energy dissipation paths have been linked with allosteric communication. To study the vibrational energy transport in the active and inactive states of these GPCRs, a master equation approach [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 045103 (2020)] is employed, which uses scaling rules that allow to calculate energy transport rates solely based on the protein structure. Despite their structural similarities, the three GPCRs reveal quite different strategies to redistribute excess energy. While bR quickly removes the energy using the TM7 helix as a "lightning rod", Rho exhibits a rather poor energy dissipation, which might eventually require the hydrolysis of the Schiff base between the protein and the retinal chromophore to prevent overheating. Heating the ligand adrenaline of B2AR, the resulting energy transport network of the protein is found to change significantly upon switching from the active to the inactive state. While the energy flow may highlight aspects of the interresidue couplings of B2AR, it seems not particularly suited to explain allosteric phenomena.},

Here we summarize recent advances in understanding the function of linkers and the advantages of adopting mutlidomain architecture with disorder linkers. It was shown that linkers between domains enhance the local domain concentration and make the allosteric regulation of weakly interacting partners possible, while linkers with only one tethered end cause an entropy effect to reduce binding affinity and prevent aggregation.},

Most of the approaches to stress tensor analysis of molecules in the literature assume that the interatomic forces are pairwise; however commonly used force-field functions contain multi-body interactions. To address this issue, we derived new mathematical formulae for atomic forces based on forcefield functions, in which the total force acting on each atom is expressed as a summation of pairwise interatomic forces. Then, a computer program for stress tensor analysis was developed, and it successfully characterized the mechanical features of molecules at the atomic level.},

  abstract = {Vibrational energy flow in proteins was studied by monitoring the timeresolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman scattering of three myoglobin mutants in which a Trp residue substitutes a different amino acid residue near heme. The anti-Stokes Raman intensities of the Trp residue in the three mutants increased with similar rates after depositing excess vibrational energy at heme, despite the difference in distance between heme and each substituted Trp residue along the main chain of the protein. This indicates that vibrational energy is not transferred through the main chain of the protein but rather through atomic contacts between heme and the Trp residue. Distinct differences were observed in the amplitude of the band intensity change between the Trp residues at different positions, and the amplitude of the band intensity change exhibits a correlation with the extent of exposure of the Trp residue to solvent water. This correlation indicates that atomic contacts between an amino acid residue and solvent water play an important role in vibrational energy flow in a protein.},

There is rapid growth in interest toward rational design of allosteric drugs. PDZ domain proteins (frequently encountered in signaling protein complexes) are classic examples of allostery without significant structural changes (dynamic allostery), where ligand binding leads to modulation in distal side-chain motions. So far dynamic allostery has been attributed to purely entropic effects. In contrast, here we show that a significant internal redistribution and rewiring of electrostatic interactions provide the basis of dynamic allostery in PDZ domain protein. A dramatic population shift in the pairwise hydrogen-bonded interactions involving side chains leads to the allosteric response.           ,              Allosteric effect implies ligand binding at one site leading to structural and/or dynamical changes at a distant site. PDZ domains are classic examples of dynamic allostery without conformational changes, where distal side-chain dynamics is modulated on ligand binding and the origin has been attributed to entropic effects. In this work, we unearth the energetic basis of the observed dynamic allostery in a PDZ3 domain protein using molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that electrostatic interaction provides a highly sensitive yardstick to probe the allosteric modulation in contrast to the traditionally used structure-based parameters. There is a significant population shift in the hydrogen-bonded network and salt bridges involving side chains on ligand binding. The ligand creates a local energetic perturbation that propagates in the form of dominolike changes in interresidue interaction pattern. There are significant changes in the nature of specific interactions (nonpolar/polar) between interresidue contacts and accompanied side-chain reorientations that drive the major redistribution of energy. Interestingly, this internal redistribution and rewiring of side-chain interactions led to large cancellations resulting in small change in the overall enthalpy of the protein, thus making it difficult to detect experimentally. In contrast to the prevailing focus on the entropic or dynamic effects, we show that the internal redistribution and population shift in specific electrostatic interactions drive the allosteric modulation in the PDZ3 domain protein.},

We construct and analyze a dynamic network in which nodes representing the residues, hemes, and water cluster are connected by edges that represent energy transport times, as well as a nonbonded network (NBN) indicating regions that respond rapidly to local strain within the protein via nonbonded interactions. One of the two largest NBNs includes the Lys30−Asp89 salt bridge critical for stabilizing the dimer. The other includes the hemes and surrounding residues, as well as, in the unliganded state, the cluster of water molecules between the globules. Energy transport in the protein appears to be controlled by the Lys30− Asp89 salt bridge critical for stabilizing the dimer, as well as the interface water cluster in the unliganded state. Possible connections between energy transport dynamics in response to local strain identified here and allosteric transitions in HbI are discussed.},

We discuss protein–water dynamics, with emphasis on water that is partially confined, and the role of protein-confined water dynamics in allosteric regulation. These properties are illustrated with two systems, a homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis (HbI) and an A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR). For HbI, water–protein interactions, long known to contribute to the thermodynamics of cooperativity, are seen to influence the dynamics of the protein not only around the protein–water interface but also into the core of each globule, where dynamic and entropic changes upon ligand binding are coupled to protein–water contact dynamics. Similarly, hydration waters trapped deep inside the core region of A2AAR enable the formation of an allosteric network made of water-mediated inter-residue contacts. Extending from the ligand binding pocket to the G-protein binding site, this allosteric network plays key roles in regulating the activity of the receptor.},

  abstract = {Protein conformational changes are activated processes essential for protein functions. Activation in a protein differs from activation in a small molecule in that it involves directed and systematic energy flows through preferred channels encoded in the protein structure. Understanding the nature of these energy flow channels and how energy flows through them during activation is critical for understanding protein conformational changes. We recently [W. Li and A. Ma, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 114103 (2016)] developed a rigorous statistical mechanical framework for understanding potential energy flows. Here, we complete this theoretical framework with a rigorous theory for kinetic energy flows: potential and kinetic energies interconvert when impressed forces oppose inertial forces, whereas kinetic energy transfers directly from one coordinate to another when inertial forces oppose each other. This theory is applied to analyzing a prototypic system for biomolecular conformational dynamics: the isomerization of an alanine dipeptide. Among the two essential energy flow channels for this process, dihedral ϕ confronts the activation barrier, whereas dihedral θ1 receives energy from potential energy flows. Intriguingly, θ1 helps ϕ to cross the activation barrier by transferring to ϕ via direct kinetic energy flow all the energy it received—an increase in  𝜃 ̇~ 1 θ̇1  caused by potential energy flow converts into an increase in  𝜙 ̇~ ϕ̇ . As a compensation, θ1 receives kinetic energy from bond angle α via a direct mechanism and bond angle β via an indirect mechanism.},

  abstract = {A long-standing challenge in protein biophysics is to understand protein quake in myoglobin─the structural dynamics responsible for redistributing the excess heme energy after photolysis. Despite extensive efforts, the molecular mechanism of this process remains elusive. Using the energy flow theory, we uncovered a fundamental new phenomenon: the heme energy is redistributed by sinusoidal waves with a ubiquitous fundamental frequency and two overtones. The energy waves emanate from the heme into the myoglobin backbone via a conduit of five consecutive dihedrals of the proximal histidine and then travel quickly along the backbone to reach sidechains across the protein. This mechanism is far more effective than the diffusion-based mechanism from previous studies because waves are systematic while diffusion is random. To propagate energy waves, coordinates must cooperate, resulting in collective modes that are singular vectors of the generalized work functional. These modes show task partitioning: a handful of high-energy modes generate large-scale breathing motion, which loosens up the protein matrix to enable hundreds of low-energy vibrational modes for energy transduction.},

  abstract = {Heme proteins are ideal systems to investigate vibrational energy flow at the atomic level. Upon photoexcitation, a large amount of excess vibrational energy is selectively deposited on heme due to extremely fast internal conversion. This excess energy is redistributed to the surrounding protein moiety and then to water. Vibrational energy flow in myoglobin (Mb) was examined using picosecond time-resolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy. We used the Trp residue directly contacting the heme group as a selective probe for vibrationally excited populations. Trp residues were placed at different position close to the heme by site-directed mutagenesis. This technique allows us to monitor the excess energy on residue-to-residue basis. Anti-Stokes UVRR measurements for Mb mutants suggest that the dominant channel for energy transfer in Mb is the pathway through atomic contacts between heme and nearby amino acid residues as well as that between the protein and solvent water. It is found that energy flow through proteins is analogous to collisional exchange processes in solutions.},

Hemeproteins are well suited for studying vibrational energy exchange in proteins because the heme group is an efficient photothermal converter. The released energy by heme following photoexcitation shows migration in a protein moiety on a picosecond timescale, which is observed using time-resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy. The anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman intensity of a tryptophan residue is an excellent probe for the vibrational energy in proteins, allowing the mapping of energy flow with the spatial resolution of a single amino acid residue. This Perspective provides an overview of studies on vibrational energy flow in proteins, including future perspectives for both methodologies and applications.},

  abstract = {The effects of ligand binding on an oxygen sensor protein, FixLH, were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. To illustrate the network of residue interactions in the deoxy, oxy, and carbomonoxy states of FixLH, we employed the energy exchange network (EEN) model in which residue interactions were evaluated in terms of local transport coefficients of energy flow. As a result, the difference map of EEN between the deoxy and oxy (deoxy and carbomonooxy) states clearly demonstrated the allosteric transition, although the structural changes by ligand binding are small. It is known that the FixLH forms a homodimer in solution, although neither O2 nor CO binding exhibits cooperativity. Therefore, we conjectured that the primary event after ligand binding occurs essentially at the monomer level, and it is subsequently followed by quaternary structural changes. The difference EEN maps showed that two regions, (A) the junction between the coiled-coil linker and the sensor domain and (B) the potential dimer interface, experienced considerable change of the energy-transport coefficients, indicating that these two regions play important roles in quaternary structural changes and signal transduction in response to ligand binding.},

  abstract = {The nature and rate of thermal transport through molecular junctions depend on the length over which thermalization occurs. For junctions formed by alkane chains, in which thermalization occurs only slowly, measurements reveal that thermal resistance is controlled by bonding with the substrates, whereas fluorination can introduce thermal resistance within the molecules themselves, although the mechanism remains unclear. Here we present results of quantum-mechanical calculations of elastic and inelastic scattering rates, the length over which thermalization occurs, and thermal conductance in alkane and perfluoroalkane junctions. The contribution to thermalization of quantum effects that give rise to many-body localization (MBL) in isolated molecules is examined. While MBL does not occur due to dephasing, thermalization is typically too slow to establish local temperature if the same molecule in isolation exhibits MBL. The results indicate limitations on the applicability of classical molecular simulations in modeling thermal transport in molecular junctions.},

Rates of energy transfer across van der Waals contacts vary inversely with the variance of the contact length, with the same constant of proportionality for all nonpolar contacts of HP36. A similar relation is observed for hydrogen bonds, but the proportionality depends on contact pairs, with hydrogen bonds stabilizing the α-helices all exhibiting the same constant of proportionality, one that is distinct from those computed for other polar contacts. Rates of energy transfer across van der Waals contacts are found to be up to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than rates of energy transfer across polar contacts.

On the basis of the reorganized network that we obtain for β2AR upon activation, we identify a branched pathway between the agonist binding site and the cytoplasmic region, where a G-protein binds to the receptor when activated. The pathway includes all of the motifs containing molecular switches previously identified as contributing to the allosteric transition of β2AR upon agonist binding. EENs and their reorganization upon activation are compared with structure-based contact networks computed for the inactive and active states of β2AR.},

The reorganized network upon activation contains contributions from structural as well as from dynamic changes and corresponding entropic contributions to the free energy of activation, which are estimated in terms of the change in rates of energy transfer across non-covalent contacts. The role of water in the EENs and in activation of GLP-1R is also investigated. The dynamics of water in contact with the central polar network of the transmembrane region is found to be significantly slower for both activated states compared to the inactive state. This result is consistent with the contribution of water molecules to activation of GLP-1R previously suggested and resembles water dynamics in parts of the transmembrane region found in earlier studies of rhodopsin-like GPCRs.},

We investigate the relationship between rates of energy transfer across polar and nonpolar contacts and contact dynamics for the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, a rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptor, in an antagonist-bound inactive state and agonist-bound active state. From structures sampled during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find the active state to have, on average, a lower packing density, corresponding to generally more flexibility and greater entropy than the inactive state. Energy exchange networks (EENs) are computed for the inactive and active states from the results of the MD simulations. From the EENs, changes in the rates of energy transfer across polar and nonpolar contacts are found for contacts that remain largely intact during activation. Change in dynamics of the contact, and entropy associated with the dynamics, can be estimated from the change in rates of energy transfer across the contacts. Measurement of change in the rates of energy transfer before and after the transition between states thereby provides information about dynamic contributions to activation and allostery.},

Both theory and the results of the simulations support a scaling relation between the energy transfer rate and the inverse of the variance in the distance between hydrogen-bonded contacts. The results of the MD simulations do not support such a relation for longer-range charged contacts. Instead, the energy transfer rate is found to scale as a power law in the distance between charged groups. The scaling between rates of vibrational energy transfer across nonbonded contacts interacting via short-range potentials and conformational dynamics suggests a relation between vibrational energy transfer rates and entropy associated with the dynamics of interacting residues.

  abstract = {In a previous paper [M. Schade, P. Hamm, Vibrational energy transport in the presence of intrasite vibrational energy redistribution, J. Chem. Phys. 131 (2009) 044511], it has been shown that on ultrashort length and time scales, the speed of vibrational energy transport along a molecular chain is limited by intrasite vibrational relaxation rather than the actual intersite propagation. However, since intrasite vibrational relaxation is length independent, the intersite propagation rate is expected to become ratelimiting at some length scale, where propagation approaches the bulk limit. In the present paper, we investigate the transition between both regimes. The response of different types of modes may be very different at early times, depending on how much they contribute directly to energy transport. Surprisingly though, when averaging the energy content over all vibrational modes of the various chain sites, the complexity of the intrasite vibrational relaxation process is completely hidden so that energy transport on the nanoscale can be described by an effective propagation rate, that equals the bulk value, even at short times.},

  abstract = {From guiding chemical reactivity in synthesis or protein folding to the design of energy diodes, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution harnesses the power to influence the underlying fundamental principles of chemistry. To evaluate the ability to steer these processes, the mechanism and time scales of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution through aromatic molecular scaffolds have been assessed by utilizing twodimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. 2D IR cross peaks reveal energy relaxation through an aromatic scaffold from the azido- to the cyanovibrational reporters in para-azidobenzonitrile (PAB) and para(azidomethyl)benzonitrile (PAMB) prior to energy relaxation into the solvent. The rates of energy transfer are modulated by Fermi resonances, which are apparent by the coupling cross peaks identified within the 2D IR spectrum. Theoretical vibrational mode analysis allowed the determination of the origins of the energy flow, the transfer pathway, and a direct comparison of the associated transfer rates, which were in good agreement with the experimental results. Large variations in energy-transfer rates, approximately 1.9 ps for PAB and 23 ps for PAMB, illustrate the importance of strong anharmonic coupling, i.e., Fermi resonance, on the transfer pathways. In particular, vibrational energy rectification is altered by Fermi resonances of the cyanoand azido-modes allowing control of the propensity for energy flow.},

  abstract = {The field of protein residue network (PRN) research has brought several useful methods and techniques for structural analysis of proteins and protein complexes. Many of these are ripe and ready to be used by the proteomics community outside of the PRN specialists. In this paper we present software which collects an ensemble of (network) methods tailored towards the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and/or interactions of proteins with ligands of other type, e.g. nucleic acids, oligosaccharides etc. In parallel, we propose the use of the network differential analysis as a method to identify residues mediating key interactions between proteins. We use a model system, to show that in combination with other, already published methods, also included in pyProGA, it can be used to make such predictions. Such extended repertoire of methods allows to cross-check predictions with other methods as well, as we show here. In addition, the possibility to construct PRN models from various kinds of input is so far a unique asset of our code. One can use structural data as defined in PDB files and/or from data on residue pair interaction energies, either from force-field parameters or fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations. pyProGA is a free open-source software available from https://gitlab.com/Vlado\_S/pyproga.},

  abstract = {While the theory of protein folding is well developed, including concepts such as rugged energy landscape, folding funnel, etc., the same degree of understanding has not been reached for the description of the dynamics of allosteric transitions in proteins. This is not only due to the small size of the structural change upon ligand binding to an allosteric site, but also due to challenges in designing experiments that directly observe such an allosteric transition. On the basis of recent pump-probe-type experiments (Buchli et al. 2013 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA110, 11 725–11 730. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1306323110)) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations (Buchenberg et al. 2017 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA114, E6804–E6811. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1707694114)) studying an photoswitchable PDZ2 domain as model for an allosteric transition, we outline in this perspective how such a description of allosteric communication might look. That is, calculating the dynamical content of both experiment and simulation (which agree remarkably well with each other), we find that allosteric communication shares some properties with downhill folding, except that it is an ‘order–order’ transition. Discussing the multiscale and hierarchical features of the dynamics, the validity of linear response theory as well as the meaning of ‘allosteric pathways’, we conclude that non-equilibrium experiments and simulations are a promising way to study dynamical aspects of allostery. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Allostery and molecular machines’.},

  abstract = {Recent time-resolved experiments and accompanying molecular dynamics simulations allow us to monitor the flow of vibrational energy in biomolecules. As a simple means to describe these experimental and simulated data, Buchenberg et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7, 25 (2016)] suggested a master equation model that accounts for the energy transport from an initially excited residue to some target residue. The transfer rates of the model were obtained from two scaling rules, which account for the energy transport through the backbone and via tertiary contacts, respectively, and were parameterized using simulation data of a small α-helical protein at low temperatures. To extend the applicability of the model to general proteins at room temperature, here a new parameterization is presented, which is based on extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a number of model systems. With typical transfer times of 0.5–1 ps between adjacent residues, backbone transport represents the fastest channel of energy flow. It is well described by a diffusive-type scaling rule, which requires only an overall backbone diffusion coefficient and interatom distances as input. Contact transport, e.g., via hydrogen bonds, is considerably slower (6–30 ps) at room temperature. A new scaling rule depending on the inverse square contact distance is suggested, which is shown to successfully describe the energy transport in the allosteric protein PDZ3. Since both scaling rules require only the structure of the considered system, the model provides a simple and general means to predict energy transport in proteins. To identify the pathways of energy transport, Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations are performed, which highlight the competition between backbone and contact transport channels.},

In addition, they also can avoid many problems related to traditional materials such as toxic chemical residues or brittleness. With the fast development of cutting-edge flexible materials and bioelectronics processing technologies, the market for biocompatible materials with extremely high or low thermal conductivity is growing rapidly. The thermal conductivity of protein films, which is usually on the order of 0.1 W/m·K, can be rather tunable as the value for stretched protein fibers can be substantially larger, outperforming that of many synthetic polymer materials. These findings indicate that the thermal conductivity and the heat transfer direction of protein-based materials can be finely controlled by manipulating their nano-scale structures. This review will focus on the structure of different fibrous proteins, such as silks, collagen and keratin, summarizing factors that can influence the thermal conductivity of protein-based materials and the different experimental methods used to measure their heat transfer properties.},

In the present study, we directly examined the contributions of covalent bonds and atomic contacts to the pathway of vibrational energy flow by comparing the anti-Stokes resonance Raman spectra of two myoglobin mutants: one lacked a covalent bond between heme and the polypeptide chain, and the other retained the intact bond. The two mutants showed no significant difference in temporal changes in the anti-Stokes Raman intensities of the tryptophan bands, implying that the dominant channel of vibrational energy transfer is not through the covalent bond but rather through van der Waals atomic contacts between heme and the protein moiety.

Heme proteins are highly suitable for studies of the vibrational energy exchanges in proteins. The migration of excess energy released by heme in a protein moiety can be observed using time-resolved anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy. The anti-Stokes resonance Raman intensity of a tryptophan residue is an excellent probe for the excess energy and the spatial resolution of a single amino acid residue can be achieved. Here, we studied dependence of vibrational energy transfer on the distance in cytochrome b562, which is a heme-containing, four-helix bundle protein. The vibrational energy transfer from the heme group to a single tryptophan residue introduced by site-directed mutagenesis was examined for different heme-tryptophan distances by a quasi-constant length with the periodicity of α helices. Taken together with structural data obtained by molecular dynamics simulations, the energy transfer could be well described by the model of classical thermal diffusion, which suggests that continuum media provide a good approximation of the protein interior, of which the atomic packing density is very high.},

  abstract = {Vibrational energy flow in the many degrees of freedom in proteins governs energy-barrier-crossing processes, such as conformational exchanges and thermal reactions. The intensity of anti-Stokes Raman bands arises from vibrationally excited populations and can thus function as a selective probe for the excess energy. Time-resolved observations of the anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) intensity of amino acid residues provide information about the flow of excess energy in proteins, with the spatial resolution of an amino acid residue. The answer to the question of whether the extent of vibrational excitation in any given vibrational modes reflects the extent of excitation in the whole molecule under nonequilibrium conditions is not straightforward. Here, we calculated the occupation probabilities of vibrational states for model compounds of amino acids under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. At a given temperature, the occupation probability of the model compound of tryptophan under nonequilibrium conditions was nearly identical to that under equilibrium conditions at high temperature. Thus, the anti-Stokes band intensities of Trp residues in the nonequilibrium condition indicate the temperature of the molecules with equivalent energy in the equilibrium condition. In addition, we showed that the temperatures calculated on the basis of two UVRR bands of tryptophan in a time-resolved spectrum agreed with each other within the experimental uncertainty. The present results demonstrate that anti-Stokes UVRR bands of Trp residues serve as an excellent spectroscopic thermometer for determining the local temperature in proteins under nonequilibrium conditions.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations can be utilized to predict protein structure ensembles and dynamics, though sufficient sampling of molecular ensembles and identification of key biologically relevant conformations remains challenging. Low-resolution experimental techniques provide valuable structural information on biomolecule at near-native conditions, which are often combined with molecular simulations to determine and refine protein structural ensembles. In this study, we demonstrate how small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) information can be incorporated in Markov state model-based adaptive sampling strategy to enhance time efficiency of unbiased MD simulations and identify functionally relevant conformations of proteins and complexes. Our results show that using SAXS data combined with additional information, such as thermodynamics and distance restraints, we are able to distinguish otherwise degenerate structures due to the inherent ambiguity of SAXS pattern. We further demonstrate that adaptive sampling guided by SAXS and hybrid information can significantly reduce the computation time required to discover target structures. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach in predicting near-native structures of proteins and complexes. Other low-resolution experimental information can be incorporated in a similar manner to collectively enhance unbiased sampling and improve the accuracy of structure prediction from simulation.},
