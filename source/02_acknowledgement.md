# Acknowledgements {.unlisted .unnumbered}

I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude
and appreciation to all those who have supported and guided me throughout
my doctoral journey.

First and foremost, I am immensely grateful to my academic supervisor, Dr. Takahisa YAMATO,
for his unwavering support, invaluable guidance, and immense knowledge.
For these three years, he provides the most excellent scientific research environment,
the best platform and resources, so that I can devote myself to scientific research and academic exchange.
Without his dedication, I am not able to contribute myself to this area.
